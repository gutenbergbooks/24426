<h4>PREFACE</h4>

anybody remember the opera of <i>The Inca</i>, and that heartbreaking
episode where the Court Undertaker, in a morbid desire to increase his
professional skill, deliberately accomplishes the destruction of his
middle-aged relatives in order to inter them for the sake of
practise?</p>

<p>If I recollect, his dismal confession runs something like this:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "quote">
“It was in a bleak November</p>
<p>When I slew them, I remember,</p>
<p>As I caught them unawares</p>
<p>Drinking tea in rocking-chairs.”</p>
</div>

<p>And so he talked them to death, the subject being “What Really is
Art?” Afterward he was sorry&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<!-- png 014 -->

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "in2">“The squeak of a door,</p>
<p class = "in2">The creak of the floor,</p>
<p>My horrors and fears enhance;</p>
<p class = "in2">And I wake with a scream</p>
<p class = "in2">As I hear in my dream</p>
<p>The shrieks of my maiden aunts!”</p>
</div>

<p>Now it is a very dreadful thing to suggest that those highly
respectable pseudo-spinsters, the Sister Arts, supposedly cozily immune
in their polygamous chastity (for every suitor for favor is popularly
expected to be wedded to his particular art)&mdash;I repeat, it is very
dreadful to suggest that these impeccable old ladies are in danger of
being talked to death.</p>

<p>But the talkers are talking and Art Nouveau rockers are rocking, and
the trousers of the prophet are patched with stained glass, and it is a
day of dinkiness and of thumbs.</p>

<p>Let us find comfort in the ancient proverb: “Art talked to death
shall rise again.” Let us also recollect that “Dinky is as dinky does”;
that “All is not Shaw that Bernards”; that “Better Yeates than Clever”;
that words are so inexpensive that there is no moral crime in robbing
Henry to pay James.</p>

<p>Firmly believing all this, abjuring all atom-pickers,
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<!-- png 015 -->
slab furniture, and woodchuck literature&mdash;save only the immortal
verse:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“And there the wooden-chuck doth tread;</p>
<p class = "in1">While from the oak trees’ tops</p>
<p>The red, red squirrel on thy head</p>
<p class = "in1">The frequent acorn drops.”</p>
</div>

<p>Abjuring, as I say, dinkiness in all its forms, we may still hope
that those cleanly and respectable spinsters, the Sister Arts, will
continue throughout the ages, rocking and drinking tea unterrified by
the million-tongued clamor in the back yard and below stairs, where
thumb and forefinger continue the question demanded by intellectual
exhaustion: “L’arr! Kesker say l’arr?”</p>

<span class = "firstword">&nbsp;ain’t</span> never knowed no one like
him,” continued the station-agent reflectively. “He made us all look
like monkeys, but he was good to us. Ever see a ginuine poet, sir?”</p>

<p>“Years ago one was pointed out to me,” replied Briggs.</p>

<p>“Was yours smooth shaved, with large, fat, white fingers?” inquired
the station-agent.</p>

<p>“If I remember correctly, he was thin,” said Briggs, sitting down on
his suit-case and gazing apprehensively around at the landscape.
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<!-- png 022 -->
There was nothing to see but low, forbidding mountains, and forests, and
a railroad track curving into a tunnel.</p>

<p>The station-agent shoved his hairy hands into the pockets of his
overalls, jingled an unseen bunch of keys, and chewed a dry grass stem,
ruminating the while in an undertone:</p>

<p>“This poet come here five years ago with all them kids, an’ the fust
thing he done was to dress up his girls in boys’ pants. Then he went an’
built a humpy sort o’ house out of stones and boulders. Then he went to
work an’ wrote pieces for the papers about jay-birds an’ woodchucks an’
goddesses. He claimed the woods was full of goddesses. That was his way,
sir.”</p>

<p>The agent contemplated the railroad track, running his eye along the
perspective of polished rails:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; his name was&mdash;and is&mdash;Clarence Guilford, an’
I&nbsp;fust seen it signed to a piece in the Uticy Star. An’ next I
knowed, folks began to stop off here inquirin’ for Mr. Guilford. ‘Is
this here where Guilford, the poet, lives?’ sez they; an’ they come
thicker an’ thicker in warm weather. There wasn’t no wagon to take ’em
up to Guilford’s, but they
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<!-- png 023 -->
didn’t care, an’ they called it a lit’r’y shrine, an’ they hit the pike,
women, children, men&mdash;’speshil the women, an’ I&nbsp;heard ’em
tellin’ how Guilford dressed his kids in pants an’ how Guilford was a
famous new lit’r’y poet, an’ they said he was fixin’ to lecture in
Uticy.”</p>

<p>The agent gnawed off the chewed portion of the grass stem, readjusted
it, and fixed his eyes on vacancy.</p>

<p>“Three year this went on. Mr. Guilford was makin’ his pile,
I&nbsp;guess. He set up a shop an’ hired art bookbinders from York. Then
he set up another shop an’ hired some of us ’round here to go an’ make
them big, slabby art-chairs. All his shops was called “At the sign of”
somethin’ ’r other. Bales of vellum arrived for to bind little dinky
books; art rocking-chairs was shipped out o’ here by the carload.
Meanwhile Guilford he done poetry on the side an’ run a magazine; an’
hearin’ the boys was makin’ big money up in that crank community, an’
that the town was boomin’, I&nbsp;was plum fool enough to drop my job
here an’ be a art-worker up to Rose-Cross&mdash;that’s where the shops
was; ’bout three mile back of his house into the woods.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<!-- png 024 -->
<p>The agent removed his hands from his overalls and folded his arms
grimly.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Briggs, looking up from his perch on the
suit-case.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” continued the agent, “the hull thing bust. I&nbsp;guess
the public kinder sickened o’ them art-rockers an’ dinky books without
much printin’ into them. Guilford he stuck to it noble, but the shops
closed one by one. My wages wasn’t paid for three months; the boys that
remained got together that autumn an’ fixed it up to quit in a
bunch.</p>

<p>“The poet was sad; he come out to the shops an’ he says, ‘Boys,’ sez
he, ‘art is long an’ life is dam brief. I&nbsp;ain’t got the cash, but,’
sez he, ‘you can levy onto them art-rockers an’ the dinky vellum books
in stock, an’,’ sez he, ‘you can take the hand-presses an’ the tools an’
bales o’ vellum, which is very precious, an’ all the wagons an’ hosses,
an’ go sell ’em in that proud world that refuses to receive my message.
The woodland fellowship is rent,’ sez he, wavin’ his plump fingers at us
with the rings sparklin’ on ’em.</p>

<p>“Then the boys looked glum, an’ they nudged me an’ kinder shoved me
front. So, bein’ elected, I&nbsp;sez, ‘Friend,’ sez I, ‘art is on
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<!-- png 025 -->
the bum. It ain’t your fault; the boys is sad an’ sorrerful, but they
ain’t never knocked you to nobody, Mr. Guilford. You was good to us; you
done your damdest. You made up pieces for the magazines an’ papers an’
you advertised how we was all cranks together here at Rose-Cross,
a-lovin’ Nature an’ dicky-birds, an’ wanderin’ about half nood for art’s
sake.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Guilford,’ sez I, ‘that gilt brick went. But it has went as far
as it can travel an’ is now reposin’ into the soup. Git wise or eat hay,
sir. Art is on the blink.’”</p>

<p>The agent jingled his keys with a melancholy wink at Briggs.</p>

<p>“So I come back here, an’ thankful to hold down this job. An’ five
mile up the pike is that there noble poet an’ his kids a-makin’ up
pieces for to sell to the papers, an’ a sorrerin’ over the cold world
what refuses to buy his poems&mdash;an’ a mortgage onto his house an’ a
threat to foreclose.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Briggs dreamily, for it was his business to attend to
the foreclosure of the mortgage on the poet’s house.</p>

<p>“Was you fixin’ to go up an’ see the place?” inquired the agent.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<!-- png 026 -->
<p>“Shall I be obliged to walk?”</p>

<p>“I guess you will if you can’t flutter,” replied the agent.
“I&nbsp;ain’t got no wagon an’ no horse.”</p>

<p>“How far is it?”</p>

<p>“Five mile, sir.”</p>

<p>With a groan Mr. Briggs arose, lifted his suit-case, and, walking to
the platform’s edge, cast an agitated glance up the dusty road.</p>

<p>Then he turned around and examined the single building in
sight&mdash;station, water-tower, post-office and telegraph-office all
in one, and incidentally the abode of the station-agent, whose duties
included that of postmaster and operator.</p>

<p>“I’ll write a letter first,” said Briggs. And this is what he
wrote:</p>

<p class = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">Rose-Cross P.O.</span>,<br>
<i>June 25, 1904</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Wayne</span>: Do you remember that
tract of land, adjoining your preserve, which you attempted to buy four
years ago? It was held by a crank community, and they refused to sell,
and made trouble for your patrols by dumping dye-stuffs and sawdust into
the Ashton Creek.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<!-- png 027 -->
<p>Well, the community has broken up, the shops are in ruins, and there
is nobody there now except that bankrupt poet, Guilford. I&nbsp;bought
the mortgage for you, foreseeing a slump in that sort of art, and I
expect to begin foreclosure proceedings and buy in the tract, which, as
you will recollect, includes some fine game cover and the Ashton stream,
where you wanted to establish a hatchery. This is a God-forsaken spot.
I’m on my way to the poet’s now. Shall I begin foreclosure proceedings
and fire him? Wire me what to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p class = "center">Yours,</p>

<p class = "righthalf smallcaps">Briggs.</p>

<p>Wayne received this letter two days later. Preoccupied as he was in
fitting out his yacht for commission, he wired briefly, “Fire poet,” and
dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>The next day, grappling with the problem of Japanese stewards and the
decadence of all sailormen, he received a telegram from Briggs:</p>

<p>“Can’t you manage to come up here?”</p>

<p>Irritated, he telegraphed back:</p>

<p>“Impossible. Why don’t you arrange to
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<!-- png 028 -->
fire poet?” And Briggs replied: “Can’t fire poet. There are extenuating
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Did you say exterminating or extenuating?” wired Wayne. “I&nbsp;said
extenuating,” replied Briggs.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant Briggs, what the devil is the matter with you? It’s
absolutely necessary that I have the Ashton stream for a hatchery, and
you know it. What sort of a business man are you, anyhow? Of course I
don’t propose to treat that poet inhumanly. Arrange to bid in the tract,
run up the price against your own bidding, and let the poet have a few

George Wayne arrived at Rose-Cross station, seaburnt, angry, and in
excellent athletic condition, Briggs locked himself in the waiting-room
and attempted to calm the newcomer from the window.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to pitch into me, George,” he said, “I’m hanged if I
come out, and you can go to Guilford’s alone.”</p>

<p>“Come out of there,” said Wayne dangerously.</p>

<p>“It isn’t because I’m afraid of you,” explained Briggs, “but it’s
merely that I don’t choose to present either you or myself to a lot
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<!-- png 033 -->
of pretty girls with the marks of conflict all over our eyes and
noses.”</p>

<p>At the words “pretty girls” Wayne’s battle-set features relaxed. He
motioned to the Pullman porter to deposit his luggage on the empty
platform; the melancholy bell-notes of the locomotive sounded, the train
moved slowly forward.</p>

<p>“Pretty girls?” he repeated in a softer voice. “Where are they
staying? Of course, under the circumstances a personal encounter is
superfluous. Where are they staying?”</p>

<p>“At Guilford’s. I told you so in my telegrams, didn’t&nbsp;I?”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t. You spoke only of a poet and his eight helpless
children.”</p>

<p>“Well, those girls are the eight children,” retorted Briggs sullenly,
emerging from the station.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. They’re his children, aren’t they&mdash;even if they are
girls, and pretty.” He offered a mollifying hand; Wayne took it, shook
it uncertainly, and fell into step beside his friend. “Eight pretty
girls,” he repeated under his breath. “What did you do, Stuyve?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<!-- png 034 -->
<p>“What was I to do?” inquired Briggs, nervously worrying his short
blond mustache. “When I arrived here I had made up my mind to fire the
poet and arrange for the hatchery and patrol. The farther I walked
through the dust of this accursed road, lugging my suit-case as you are
doing now, the surer I was that I’d get rid of the poet without mercy.
But<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Wayne, astonished.</p>

<p>“But when I’d trudged some five miles up the stifling road I suddenly
emerged into a wonderful mountain meadow. I&nbsp;tell you, George, it
looked fresh and sweet as Heaven after that dusty, parching
tramp&mdash;a mountain meadow deep with mint and juicy green grasses,
and all cut up by little rushing streams as cold as ice. There were a
lot of girls in pink sunbonnets picking wild strawberries in the middle
distance,” he added thoughtfully. “It was picturesque, wasn’t it? Come,
now, George, wouldn’t that give you pause?&mdash;eight girls in pink
pajamas<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“What!!!”</p>

<p>“And sunbonnets&mdash;a sort of dress reform of the poet’s.”</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Wayne coldly.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<!-- png 035 -->
<p>“And there was the ‘house beautiful,’ mercifully screened by woods,”
continued Briggs. “He calls it the house beautiful, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why not the beautiful house?” asked Wayne, still more coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, he gets everything upside down. Guilford is harmless, you’ll
see.” He began to whistle Fatinitza softly. There was a silence; then
Wayne said:</p>

<p>“You interrupted your narrative.”</p>

<p>“Where was I?”</p>

<p>“In the foreground with eight pink pajamas in the middle
distance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. So there I was, travel-worn, thirsty, weary, uncertain<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Cut it,” observed Wayne.</p>

<p>“And a stranger,” continued Briggs with dignity, “in a strange
country<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Peculiarity of strangers.”</p>

<p>Briggs took no notice. “I drank from the cool springs;
I&nbsp;lingered to pluck a delicious berry or two, I&nbsp;bathed my hot
face,&nbsp;I<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Where,” demanded Wayne, “were the eight pink ’uns?”</p>

<p>“Still in the middle distance. Don’t interrupt me, George; I’m slowly
drawing closer to them.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<!-- png 036 -->
<p>“Well, get a move on,” retorted Wayne sulkily.</p>

<p>“I’m quite close to them now,” explained Briggs; “close enough to
remove my hat and smile and inquire the way to Guilford’s. One superb
young creature, with creamy skin and very red lips<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Wayne halted and set down his suit-case.</p>

<p>“I’m not romancing; you’ll see,” said Briggs earnestly. “As I was
saying, this young goddess looked at me in the sweetest way and said
that Guilford was her father. And, Wayne, do you know what she did?
She&mdash;er&mdash;came straight up to me and took hold of my hand, and
led me up the path toward the high-art house, which is built of
cobblestones! Think! Built of cobble<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Took you by the hand?” repeated Wayne incredulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was all right, George! I found out all about that sort of
innocent thing later.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. These girls have been brought up like so many guileless
speckled fawns out here in the backwoods. You know all about Guilford,
the poet who’s dead stuck on Nature and simplicity. Well, that’s the man
and
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<!-- png 037 -->
that’s his pose. He hasn’t any money, and he won’t work. His daughters
raise vegetables, and he makes ’em wear bloomers, and he writes about
chippy-birds and the house beautiful, and tells people to be natural,
and wishes that everybody could go around without clothes and pick
daisies<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Do <i>they</i>?” demanded Wayne in an awful voice. “You <i>said</i>
they wore bloomers. Did you say that to break the news more gently? Did
you!”</p>

<p>“Of course they are clothed,” explained his friend querulously;
“though sometimes they wade about without shoes and stockings and do the
nymph business. And, George, it’s astonishing how modest that sort of
dress is. And it’s amazing how much they know. Why, they can talk
Greek&mdash;<i>talk</i> it, mind you. Every one of them can speak half a
dozen languages&mdash;Guilford is a corker on culture, you
know&mdash;and they can play harps and pianos and things, and give me
thirty at tennis, even Chlorippe, the twelve-year-old<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Is that her name?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Chlorippe? Yes. That bat-headed poet named all his children after
butterflies. Let’s see,” he continued, telling off the names on
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<!-- png 038 -->
his fingers; “there’s Chlorippe, twelve; Philodice, thirteen; Dione,
fourteen; Aphrodite, fifteen; Cybele, sixteen; Lissa, seventeen; Iole,
eighteen, and Vanessa, nineteen. And, Wayne, never have the Elysian
fields contained such a bunch of wholesome beauty as that mountain
meadow contains all day long.”</p>

<p>Wayne, trudging along, suit-case firmly gripped, turned a pair of
suspicious eyes upon his friend.</p>

<p>“Of course,” observed Briggs candidly, “I&nbsp;simply couldn’t
foreclose on the father of such children, could&nbsp;I? Besides, he
won’t let me discuss the subject.”</p>

<p>“I’ll investigate the matter personally,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“Nowhere to lay their heads! Think of it, George. And all because a
turtle-fed, claret-flushed, idle and rich young man wants their earthly
Paradise for a fish-hatchery. Think of it! A&nbsp;pampered,
turtle-fed<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“You’ve said that before,” snapped Wayne. “If you were half decent
you’d help me with this suit-case. Whew! It’s hot as Yonkers on this
cattle-trail you call a road. How near are we to Guilford’s?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<!-- png 039 -->
<p>An hour later Briggs said: “By the way, George, what are you going to
do about the matter?”</p>

<p>Wayne, flushed, dusty, perspiring, scowled at him.</p>

<p>“What matter?”</p>

<p>“The foreclosure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; how can I know until I see Guilford?”</p>

<p>“But you need the hatchery<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t let you discuss it<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“If,” said Wayne angrily, “you had spent half the time talking
business with the poet that you spent picking strawberries with his
helpless children I should not now be lugging this suit-case up this
mountain. Decency requires few observations from <i>you</i> just
now.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Briggs. “Wait till you see Iole.”</p>

<p>“Why Iole? Why not Vanessa?”</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;that’s all,” retorted Briggs, reddening.</p>

<p>Wayne plumped his valise down in the dust, mopped his brow, folded
his arms, and regarded Briggs between the eyes.</p>

<p>“You have the infernal cheek, after getting
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<!-- png 040 -->
me up here, to intimate that you have taken the pick?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Briggs firmly. The two young fellows faced each
other.</p>

<p>“By the way,” observed Briggs casually, “the stock they come from is
as good if not better than ours. This is a straight game.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you&mdash;you are&mdash;seriously<span class
= "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Something like it. There! Now you know.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Stuyve<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, for Heaven’s sake and in Heaven’s name don’t get any wrong
ideas into your vicious head.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Briggs, “that I was never closer to falling in
love than I am to-day. And I’ve been here just two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Amen,” muttered Briggs. “Here, give me your carpet-bag, you brute.
We’re on the edge of Paradise.”</p>

we discuss my financial difficulties,” said the poet, lifting his plump
white hand and waving it in unctuous waves about the veranda, “let me
show you our home, Mr. Wayne. May&nbsp;I?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Wayne politely, following Guilford into the
house.</p>

<p>They entered a hall; there was absolutely nothing in the hall except
a small table on which reposed a single daisy in a glass of water.</p>

<p>“Simplicity,” breathed Guilford&mdash;“a single blossom against a
background of nothing at all. You follow me, Mr. Wayne?”</p>

<!-- png 044 -->

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<!-- png 042 -->
<p>“Not&mdash;exactly<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>The poet smiled a large, tender smile, and, with inverted thumb,
executed a gesture as though making several spots in the air.</p>

<p>“The concentration of composition,” he explained; “the elimination of
complexity; the isolation of the concrete in the center of the abstract;
something in the midst of nothing. It is a very precious thought, Mr.
Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” muttered Wayne; and they moved&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>“This,” said the poet, “is what I call my den.”</p>

<p>Wayne, not knowing what to say, sidled around the walls. It was
almost bare of furniture; what there was appeared to be of the slab
variety.</p>

<p>“I call my house the house beautiful,” murmured Guilford with his
large, sweet smile. “Beauty is simplicity; beauty is unconsciousness;
beauty is the child of elimination. A&nbsp;single fly in an empty room
is beautiful to me, Mr. Wayne.”</p>

<p>“They carry germs,” muttered Wayne, but the poet did not hear him and
led the way to another enormous room, bare of everything
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<!-- png 045 -->
save for eight thick and very beautiful Kazak rugs on the polished
floor.</p>

<p>“My children’s bedroom,” he whispered solemnly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say they sleep on those Oriental rugs!” stammered
Wayne.</p>

<p>“They do,” murmured the poet. The tender sweetness of his ample smile
was overpowering&mdash;like too much bay rum after shaving. “Sparta, Mr.
Wayne, Sparta! And the result? My babes are perfect, physically,
spiritually. Elimination wrought the miracle; yonder they sleep,
innocent as the Graces, with all the windows open, clothed in moonlight
or starlight, as the astronomical conditions may be. At the break of
dawn they are afield, simply clothed, free limbed, unhampered by the
tawdry harness of degenerate civilization. And as they wander through
the verdure,” he added with rapt enthusiasm, “plucking shy blossoms,
gathering simples and herbs and vegetables for our bountiful and natural
repast, they sing as they go, and every tremulous thrill of melody falls
like balm on a father’s heart.” The overpowering sweetness of his smile
drugged Wayne. Presently he edged toward the door, and the poet
followed, a
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<!-- png 046 -->
dreamy radiance on his features as though emanating from sacred inward
meditation.</p>

<p>They sat down on the veranda; Wayne fumbled for his cigar-case, but
his unnerved fingers fell away; he dared not smoke.</p>

<p>“About&mdash;about that business matter,” he ventured feebly; but the
poet raised his plump white hand.</p>

<p>“You are my guest,” he said graciously. “While you are my guest
nothing shall intrude to cloud our happiness.”</p>

<p>Perplexed, almost muddled, Wayne strove in vain to find a reason for
the elimination of the matter that had interrupted his cruise and
brought him to Rose-Cross, the maddest yachtsman on the Atlantic. Why
should Guilford forbid the topic as though its discussion were painful
to Wayne?</p>

<p>“He always gets the wrong end foremost, as Briggs said,” thought the
young man. “I&nbsp;wonder where the deuce Briggs can be? I’m no match
for this bunch.”</p>

<p>His thoughts halted; he became aware that the poet was speaking in a
rich, resonant voice, and he listened in an attitude of painful
politeness.</p>

<p>“It’s the little things that are most precious,”
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<!-- png 047 -->
the poet was saying, and pinched the air with forefinger and thumb and
pursed up his lips as though to whistle some saccharine air.</p>

<p>“The little things,” he continued, delicately perforating the
atmosphere as though selecting a diatom.</p>

<p>“Big things go, too,” ventured Wayne.</p>

<p>“No,” said the poet; “no&mdash;or rather they <i>do</i> go, in a
certain sense, for every little thing is precious, and therefore little
things are big!&mdash;-big with portent, big in value. Do you follow me,
Mr. Wayne?”</p>

<p>Wayne’s fascinated eyes were fixed on the poet. The latter picked out
another atom from the atmosphere and held it up for Mr. Wayne’s
inspection; and while that young man’s eyes protruded the poet rambled
on and on until the melody of his voice became a ceaseless sound, a
vague, sustained monotone, which seemed to bore into Wayne’s brain until
his legs twitched with a furious desire for flight.</p>

<p>When he obtained command of himself the poet was saying, “It is my
hour for withdrawal. It were insincere and artificial to ask your
indulgence<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He rose to his rotund height.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<!-- png 048 -->
<p>“You are due to sit in your cage,” stammered Wayne,
comprehending.</p>

<p>“My den,” corrected the poet, saturating the air with the sweetness
of his smile.</p>

<p>Wayne arose. “About that business&mdash;” he began desperately; but
the poet’s soft, heavy hand hovered in mid-air, and Wayne sat down so
suddenly that when his eyes recovered their focus the poet had
disappeared.</p>

<p>A benumbed resentment struggled within him for adequate expression;
he hitched his chair about to command a view of the meadow, then sat
motionless, hypnotized by the view. Eight girls, clad in pink blouses
and trousers, golden hair twisted up, decorated the landscape. Some were
kneeling, filling baskets of woven, scented grasses with wild
strawberries; some were wading the branches of the meadow brook,
searching for trout with grass-woven nets; some picked early peas; two
were playing a lightning set at tennis. And in the center of everything
that was going on was Briggs, perfectly at ease, making himself
agreeably at home.</p>

<p>The spectacle of Briggs among the Hamadryads appeared to paralyze
Wayne.</p>

<p>Then an immense, intense resentment set
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<!-- png 049 -->
every nerve in him tingling. Briggs, his friend, his confidential
business adviser, his indispensable <i>alter ego</i>, had abandoned him
to be tormented by this fat, saccharine poet&mdash;abandoned him while
he, Briggs, made himself popular with eight of the most amazingly
bewitching maidens mortal man might marvel on! The meanness stung Wayne
till he jumped to his feet and strode out into the sunshine, menacing
eyes fastened on Briggs.</p>

<p>“Now wouldn’t that sting you!” he breathed fiercely, turning up his
trousers and stepping gingerly across the brook.</p>

<p>Whether or not Briggs saw him coming and kept sidling away he could
not determine; he did not wish to shout; he kept passing pretty girls
and taking off his hat, and following Briggs about, but he never seemed
to come any nearer to Briggs; Briggs always appeared in the middle
distance, flitting genially from girl to girl; and presently the
absurdity of his performance struck Wayne, and he sat down on the bank
of the brook, too mad to think. There was a pretty girl picking
strawberries near-by; he rose, took off his hat to her, and sat down
again. She was one of those graceful, clean-limbed, creamy-skinned
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<!-- png 050 -->
creatures described by Briggs; her hair was twisted up into a heavy,
glistening knot, showing the back of a white neck; her eyes matched the
sky and her lips the berries she occasionally bit into or dropped to the
bottom of her woven basket.</p>

<p>Once or twice she looked up fearlessly at Wayne as her search for
berries brought her nearer; and Wayne forgot the perfidy of Briggs in an
effort to look politely amiable.</p>

<p>Presently she straightened up where she was kneeling in the long
grass and stretched her arms. Then, still kneeling, she gazed curiously
at Wayne with all the charm of a friendly wild thing unafraid.</p>

<p>“Shall we play tennis?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Wayne, startled.</p>

<p>“Come, then,” she said, picking up her basket in one hand and
extending the other to Wayne.</p>

<p>He took the fresh, cool fingers, and turned scarlet. Once his glance
sneaked toward Briggs, but that young man was absorbed in fishing for
brook trout with a net! Oh, ye little fishes! with a <i>net</i>!</p>

<p>Wayne’s brain seemed to be swarming with glittering pink-winged
thoughts all singing.
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<!-- png 051 -->
He walked on air, holding tightly to the hand of his goddess, seeing
nothing but a blur of green and sunshine. Then a clean-cut idea stabbed
him like a stiletto: was this Vanessa or Iole? And, to his own
astonishment, he asked her quite naturally.</p>

<p>“Iole,” she said, laughing. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness,” he said irrationally.</p>

<p>“But why?” she persisted curiously.</p>

<p>“Briggs&mdash;Briggs&mdash;” he stammered, and got no further.
Perplexed, his goddess walked on, thoughtful, pure-lidded eyes searching
some reasonable interpretation for the phrase, “Briggs&mdash;Briggs.”
But as Wayne gave her no aid, she presently dismissed the problem, and
bade him select a tennis bat.</p>

<p>“I do hope you play well,” she said. Her hope was comparatively vain;
she batted Wayne around the court, drove him wildly from corner to
corner, stampeded him with volleys, lured him with lobs, and finally
left him reeling dizzily about, while she came around from behind the
net, saying, “It’s all because you have no tennis shoes. Come; we’ll
rest under the trees and console ourselves with chess.”</p>

<p>Under a group of huge silver beeches a
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<!-- png 052 -->
stone chess-table was set embedded in the moss; and Iole indolently
stretched herself out on one side, chin on hands, while Wayne sorted
weather-beaten basalt and marble chess-men which lay in a pile under the
tree.</p>

<p>She chatted on without the faintest trace of self-consciousness the
while he arranged the pieces; then she began to move. He took a long
time between each move; but no sooner did he move than, still talking,
she extended her hand and shoved her piece into place without a fraction
of a second’s hesitation.</p>

<p>When she had mated him twice, and he was still gazing blankly at the
mess into which she had driven his forces, she sat up sideways,
gathering her slim ankles into one hand, and cast about her for
something to do, eyes wandering over the sunny meadow.</p>

<p>“We had horses,” she mused; “we rode like demons, bareback, until
trouble came.”</p>

<p>“Trouble?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not trouble&mdash;poverty. So our horses had to go. What shall
we do&mdash;you and&nbsp;I?” There was something so subtly sweet, so
exquisitely innocent in the coupling of the pronouns that a thrill
passed completely through
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<!-- png 053 -->
Wayne, and probably came out on the other side.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do,” he said, drawing a note-book and a
pencil from his pocket and beginning to write, holding it so she could
see.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to look over your shoulder?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Please.”</p>

<p>She did; and it affected his penmanship so that the writing grew
wabbly. Still she could read:</p>

<p class = "center">(<i>Telegram</i>)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">To Sailing Master, Yacht Thendara, Bar
Harbor</span>:</p>

<p>Put boat out of commission. I may be away all summer.</p>

<p class = "righthalf smallcaps">Wayne.</p>

<p>“How far is it to the station?” asked Wayne, turning to look into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Only five miles,” she said. “I’ll walk with you if you like.
Shall&nbsp;I?”</p>

observed the poet, waving his heavy white hand, “is a figure of speech,
Mr. Wayne. Only by the process of elimination can one arrive at the
exquisite simplicity of poverty&mdash;care-free poverty. Even a single
penny is a burden&mdash;the flaw in the marble, the fly in the amber of
perfection. Cast it away and enter Eden!” And joining thumb and
forefinger, he plucked a figurative copper from the atmosphere, tossed
it away, and wiped his fingers on his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” began Wayne uneasily.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<!-- png 055 -->
<p>“Try it,” smiled the poet, diffusing sweetness; “try it. Dismiss all
thoughts of money from your mind.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Wayne, somewhat relieved. “I&nbsp;thought you meant for
me to chuck my securities overboard and eat herbs.”</p>

<p>“Not in your case&mdash;no, not in your case. <i>I</i> can do that;
I&nbsp;have done it. No, your sacred mission is simply to forget that
you are wealthy. That is a very precious thought, Mr. Wayne&mdash;remain
a Crœsus and forget it! Not to eliminate your <i>wealth</i>, but
eliminate all <i>thought</i> of it. Very, very precious.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never think about things like that except at a directors’
meeting,” blurted out the young fellow. “Perhaps it’s because I’ve never
had to think about&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>The poet sighed so sweetly that the atmosphere seemed to drip with
the saccharine injection.</p>

<p>“I wish,” ventured Wayne, “that you would let me mention the subject
of business”&mdash;the poet shook his head indulgently&mdash;“just to
say that I’m not going to foreclose.” He laid a packet of legal papers
in the poet’s hand.</p>

<p>“Hush,” smiled Guilford, “this is not

seemly in the house beautiful.... <i>What</i> was it you said, Mr.
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“I? I was going to say that I just wanted&mdash;wanted to stay
here&mdash;be your guest, if you’ll let me,” he said honestly.
“I&nbsp;was cruising&mdash;I didn’t
understand&mdash;Briggs&mdash;Briggs&mdash;” He stuck.</p>

<p>“Yes, Briggs,” softly suggested the poet, spraying the night air with
more sweetness.</p>

<p>“Briggs has spoken to you about&mdash;about your daughter Vanessa.
You see, Briggs is my closest friend; his happiness
is&mdash;er&mdash;important to me. I&nbsp;want to see Briggs happy;
that’s why I want to stay here, just to see Briggs happy. I&mdash;I love
Briggs. You understand me, don’t you, Mr. Guilford?”</p>

<p>The poet breathed a dulcet breath. “Perfectly,” he murmured. “The
contemplation of Mr. Briggs’ happiness eliminates all thoughts of self
within you. By this process of elimination you arrive at happiness
yourself. Ah, the thought is a very precious one, my young friend, for
by elimination only can we arrive at perfection. Thank you for the
thought; thank you. You have given me a very, very precious thought to
cherish.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I have been here a week,” muttered
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<!-- png 057 -->
Wayne. “I&nbsp;thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;my welcome might be
outworn<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“In the house beautiful,” murmured the poet, rising and waving his
heavy white hand at the open door, “welcome is eternal.” He folded his
arms with difficulty, for he was stout, and one hand clutched the legal
papers; his head sank. In profound meditation he wandered away into the
shadowy house, leaving Wayne sitting on the veranda rail, eyes fixed on
a white shape dimly seen moving through the moonlit meadows below.
Briggs sauntered into sight presently, his arms full of flowers.</p>

<p>“Get me a jug of water, will you? Vanessa has been picking these and
she sent me back to fix ’em. Hurry, man! She is waiting for me in the
garden.” Wayne gazed earnestly at his friend.</p>

<p>“So you have done it, have you, Stuyve?”</p>

<p>“Done what?” demanded Briggs, blushing.</p>

<p>“It.”</p>

<p>“If you mean,” he said with dignity, “that I’ve asked the sweetest
girl on earth to marry me, I&nbsp;have. And I’m the happiest man on the
footstool, too. Good Heaven, George,” he broke out, “if you knew the
meaning of love!
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<!-- png 058 -->
if you could for one second catch a glimpse of the beauty of her soul!
Why, man of sordid clay that I was&mdash;creature of club and claret and
turtle&mdash;like you<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Drop it!” said Wayne somberly.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, George. We were beasts&mdash;and <i>you</i> are
yet. But my base clay is transmuted, spiritualized; my soul is awake,
traveling, toiling toward the upward heights where hers sits enthroned.
When I think of what I was, and what you still are<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Wayne rose exasperated:</p>

<p>“Do you think your soul is doing the only upward hustling?” he said
hotly.</p>

<p>Briggs, clasping his flowers to his breast, gazed out over them at
Wayne.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, I&nbsp;do,” said Wayne. “I may be crazy, but I know something,”
with which paradox he turned on his heel and walked into the moonlit
meadow toward that dim, white form moving through the dusk.</p>

<p>“I wondered,” she said, “whether you were coming,” as he stepped
through the long, fragrant grass to her side.</p>

<p>“You might have wondered if I had not come,” he answered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<!-- png 059 -->
<p>“Yes, that is true. This moonlight is too wonderful to miss,” she
added without a trace of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>“It was for you I came.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you find my sisters?” she asked innocently.</p>

<p>He did not reply. Presently she stumbled over a hummock, recovered
her poise without comment, and slipped her hand into his with
unconscious confidence.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I have been studying to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That curious phycomycetous fungus that produces resting-spores by
the conjugation of two similar club-shaped hyphæ, and in which conidia
also occur. It’s fascinating.”</p>

<p>After a silence he said:</p>

<p>“What would you think of me if I told you that I do not comprehend a
single word of what you have just told&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” she asked, astonished.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, dropping her hand. She wondered, vaguely
distressed; and he went on presently: “As a plain matter of fact,
I&nbsp;don’t know much. It’s an astonishing discovery for me, but it’s a
fact that I am not
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<!-- png 060 -->
your mental, physical, or spiritual equal. In sheer, brute strength
perhaps I am, and I am none too certain of that, either. But, and I say
it to my shame, I&nbsp;can not follow you; I&nbsp;am inferior in
education, in culture, in fine instinct, in mental development. You
chatter in a dozen languages to your sisters: my French appals a Paris
cabman; you play any instrument I ever heard of: the guitar is my limit,
the fandango my repertoire. As for alert intelligence, artistic
comprehension, ability to appreciate, I&nbsp;can not make the running
with you; I&nbsp;am outclassed&mdash;hopelessly. Now, if this is all
true&mdash;and I have spoken the wretched truth&mdash;<i>what</i> can a
man like me have to say for himself?”</p>

<p>Her head was bent, her fair face was in shadow. She strayed on a
little way, then, finding herself alone, turned and looked back at him
where he stood. For a moment they remained motionless, looking at one
another, then, as on some sweet impulse, she came back hastily and
looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I do not feel as you do,” she said; “you are
very&mdash;good&mdash;company. I&nbsp;am not all you say; I&nbsp;know
very little. Listen. It&mdash;it distresses
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<!-- png 061 -->
me to have you think I hold you&mdash;lightly. Truly we are <i>not</i>
apart.”</p>

<p>“There is but one thing that can join us.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Love.”</p>

<p>Her pure gaze did not falter nor her eyes droop. Curiously regarding
him, she seemed immersed in the solution of the problem as he had
solved&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“Do you love me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“With all my soul&mdash;such as it is, with all my heart, with every
thought, every instinct, every breath I draw.”</p>

<p>She considered him with fearless eyes; the beauty of them was all he
could endure.</p>

<p>“You love me?” she repeated.</p>

<p>He bent his head, incapable of speech.</p>

<p>“You wish me to love you?”</p>

<p>He looked at her, utterly unable to move his lips.</p>

<p>“<i>How</i> do you wish me to love you?”</p>

<p>He opened his arms; she stepped forward, close to him.</p>

<p>Then their lips met.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said faintly, “I did not know it&mdash;it was so
sweet.”</p>

<p>And as her head fell back on his arm about
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<!-- png 062 -->
her neck she looked up at him full of wonder at this new knowledge he
had taught her, marvelous, unsuspected, divine in its simplicity. Then
the first delicate blush that ever mounted her face spread, tinting
throat and forehead; she drew his face down to her own.</p>

<p class = "dots">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poet paced the dim veranda, arms folded, head bent. But his
glance was sideways and full of intelligence as it included two vague
figures coming slowly back through the moon-drenched meadow.</p>

<p>“By elimination we arrive at perfection,” he mused; “and perfection
is success. There remain six more,” he added irrelevantly, “but they’re
young yet. Patience, subtle patience&mdash;and attention to the little
things.” He pinched a morsel of air out of the darkness, examined it and
released&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“The little things,” he repeated; “that is a very precious
thought.... I&nbsp;believe the sea air may agree with me&mdash;now and
then.”</p>

<p>And he wandered off into his “den” and unlocked a drawer in his desk,
and took out a bundle of legal papers, and tore them slowly, carefully,
into very small pieces.</p>

double wedding at the Church of Sainte Cicindella was pretty and
sufficiently fashionable to inconvenience traffic on Fifth Avenue.
Partly from loyalty, partly from curiosity, the clans of Wayne and
Briggs, with their offshoots and social adherents, attended; and they
saw Briggs and Wayne on their best behavior, attended by Sudbury Grey
and Winsted Forest; and they saw two bridal visions of loveliness,
attended by six additional sister visions as bridesmaids; and they saw
the poet, agitated with the holy emotions of a father, now almost
unmanned, now rallying, spraying
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<!-- png 064 -->
the hushed air with sweetness. They saw clergymen and a bishop, and the
splendor of stained glass through which ushers tiptoed. And they heard
the subdued rustling of skirts and the silken stir, and the great organ
breathing over Eden, and a single artistically-modulated sob from the
poet. A&nbsp;good many other things they heard and saw, especially those
of the two clans who were bidden to the breakfast at Wayne’s big and
splendid house on the southwest corner of Seventy-ninth Street and
Madison Avenue.</p>

<p>For here they were piped to breakfast by the boatswain of Wayne’s big
seagoing yacht, the <i>Thendara</i>&mdash;on which brides and grooms
were presently to embark for Cairo via the Azores&mdash;and speeches
were said and tears shed into goblets glimmering with vintages worth
prayerful consideration.</p>

<p>And in due time two broughams, drawn by dancing horses, with the
azure ribbons aflutter from the head-stalls, bore away two very
beautiful and excited brides and two determined, but entirely rattled,
grooms. And after that several relays of parents fraternized with the
poet and six daughters, and the clans of Briggs and of Wayne said a
number of agreeable
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<!-- png 065 -->
things to anybody who cared to listen; and as everybody did listen,
there was a great deal of talk&mdash;more talk in a minute than the
sisters of Iole had heard in all their several limited and innocently
natural existences. So it confused them, not with its quality, but its
profusion; and the champagne made their cheeks feel as though the soft
peachy skin fitted too tight, and a number of persistent musical
instruments were being tuned in their little ears; and, not yet
thoroughly habituated to any garments except pink sunbonnets and
pajamas, their straight fronts felt too tight, and the tops of their
stockings pulled, and they balanced badly on their high heels, and
Aphrodite and Cybele, being too snugly laced, retired to rid themselves
of their first corsets.</p>

<p>The remaining four, Lissa, now eighteen; Dione, fifteen; Philodice,
fourteen, and Chlorippe, thirteen, found the missing Pleiads in the
great library, joyously donning their rose-silk lounging pajamas, while
two parlor maids brought ices from the wrecked feast below.</p>

<p>So they, too, flung from them crinkling silk and diaphanous lace,
high-heel shoon and the delicate body-harness never fashioned for
free-limbed dryads of the Rose-Cross wilds;
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<!-- png 066 -->
and they kept the electric signals going for ices and fruits and
pitchers brimming with clear cold water; and they sat there in a circle
like a thicket of fluttering pale-pink roses, until below the last guest
had sped out into the unknown wastes of Gotham, and the poet’s heavy
step was on the stair.</p>

<p>The poet was agitated&mdash;and like a humble bicolored quadruped of
the Rose-Cross wilds, which, when agitated, sprays the air&mdash;so the
poet, laboring obesely under his emotion, smiled with a sweetness so
intolerable that the air seemed to be squirted full of saccharinity to
the point of plethoric saturation.</p>

<p>“My lambs,” he murmured, fat hands clasped and dropped before him as
straight as his rounded abdomen would permit; “my babes!”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” suggested Aphrodite, busy with her ice, “that we are
going to enjoy this winter in Mr. Wayne’s house?”</p>

<p>“Enjoyment,” breathed the poet in an overwhelming gush of sweetness,
“is not in houses; it is in one’s soul. What is wealth? Everything!
Therefore it is of no value. What is poverty? Nothing! And, as it is the
little things that are the most precious,
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<!-- png 067 -->
so nothing, which is less than the very least, is precious beyond price.
Thank you for listening; thank you for understanding. Bless you.”</p>

<p>And he wandered away, almost asphyxiated with his emotions.</p>

<p>“I mean to have a gay winter&mdash;if I can ever get used to being
laced in and pulled over by those dreadful garters,” observed Aphrodite,
stretching her smooth young limbs in comfort.</p>

<p>“I suppose there would be trouble if we wore our country clothes on
Broadway, wouldn’t there?” asked Lissa wistfully.</p>

<p>Chlorippe, aged thirteen, kicked off her sandals and stretched her
pretty snowy feet: “They were never in the world made to fit into
high-heeled shoes,” she declared pensively, widening her little rosy
toes.</p>

<p>“But we might as well get used to all these things,” sighed
Philodice, rolling over among the cushions, a bunch of hothouse grapes
suspended above her pink mouth. She ate one, looked at Dione, and
yawned.</p>

<p>“I’m going to practise wearing ’em an hour a day,” said Aphrodite,
“because I mean to go to the theater. It’s worth the effort. Besides,
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<!-- png 068 -->
if we just sit here in the house all day asking each other Greek
riddles, we will never see anybody until Iole and Vanessa come back from
their honeymoon and give teas and dinners for all sorts of interesting
young men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the attractive young men I have seen in these few days in New
York!” exclaimed Lissa. “Would you believe it, the first day I walked
out with George Wayne and Iole, I&nbsp;was perfectly bewildered and
enchanted to see so many delightful-looking men. And by and by Iole
missed me, and George came back and found me standing entranced on the
corner of Fifth Avenue; and I said, “Please don’t disturb me, George,
because I am only standing here to enjoy the sight of so many
agreeable-looking men<ins class = "correction" title = "missing close quote">.” </ins>But he acted so queerly about it.” She ended with a
little sigh. “However, I&nbsp;love George, of course, even if he does
bore me. I&nbsp;wonder where they are now&mdash;the bridal pairs?”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Philodice, “whether they have any children by this
time?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” explained Aphrodite. “But they’ll probably have some when
they return. I&nbsp;understand it takes a good many weeks&mdash;to<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<!-- png 069 -->
<p>“To find new children,” nodded Chlorippe confidently. “I&nbsp;suppose
they’ve hidden the cunning little things somewhere on the yacht, and
it’s like hunt the thimble and lots and lots of fun.” And she
distributed six oranges.</p>

<p>Lissa was not so certain of that, but, discussing the idea with
Cybele, and arriving at no conclusion, devoted herself to the large
juicy orange with more satisfaction, conscious that the winter’s outlook
was bright for them all and full of the charming mystery of
anticipations so glittering yet so general that she could form not even
the haziest ideas of their wonderful promise. And so, sucking the sunlit
pulp of their oranges, they were content to live, dream, and await
fulfilment under the full favor of a Heaven which had never yet sent
them aught but happiness beneath the sun.</p>

Lethbridge nor Harrow&mdash;lately exceedingly important undergraduates
at Harvard and now twin nobodies in the employment of the great
Occidental Fidelity and Trust Company&mdash;neither of these young men,
I&nbsp;say, had any particular business at the New Arts Theater that
afternoon.</p>

<p>For the play was Barnard Haw’s <i>Attitudes</i>, the performance was
private and intensely intellectual, the admission by invitation only,
and between the acts there was supposed to be a general <i>causerie</i>
among the gifted individuals of the audience.</p>

<p>Why Stanley West, president of the Occidental
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<!-- png 071 -->
Trust, should have presented to his two young kinsmen the tickets
inscribed with his own name was a problem, unless everybody else,
including the elevator boys, had politely declined the offer.</p>

<p>“That’s probably the case,” observed Lethbridge. “Do we&nbsp;go?”</p>

<p>“Art,” said Harrow, “will be on the loose among that audience. And if
anybody can speak to anybody there, we’ll get spoken to just as if we
were sitting for company, and first we know somebody will ask us what
Art really&nbsp;is.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see a place full of atmosphere,” suggested Lethbridge.
“I’ve seen almost everything&mdash;the Café Jaune, and Chinatown,
and&mdash;you remember that joint at Tangier? But I’ve never seen
atmosphere. I&nbsp;don’t care how thin it is; I&nbsp;just want to say
that I’ve seen it when the next girl throws it all over me.” And as
Harrow remained timid, he added: “We won’t have to climb across the
footlights and steal a curl from the author, because he’s already being
sheared in England. There’s nothing to scare you.”</p>

<p>Normally, however, they were intensely afraid of Art except at their
barbers’, and
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<!-- png 072 -->
they had heard, in various ways as vague as Broad Street rumors,
something concerning these gatherings of the elect at the New Arts
Theater on Saturday afternoons, where unselfish reformers produced plays
for Art’s sake as a rebuke to managers who declined to produce that sort
of play for anybody’s sake.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet,” said Harrow, “that some thrifty genius sent Stanley West
those tickets in a desperate endeavor to amalgamate the aristocracies of
wealth and intellect!&mdash;as though you could shake ’em up as you
shake a cocktail! As though you’d catch your Uncle Stanley wearing his
richest Burgundy flush, sitting in the orchestra and talking <i>Arr
Noovo</i> to a young thing with cheek-bones who’d pinch him into a
cocked hat for a contribution between the acts!”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Lethbridge, “even Art requires a wad to pay its
license. Isn’t West the foxy Freddie! Do you suppose, if we go, they’ll
sting us for ten?”</p>

<p>“They’ll probably take up a collection for the professor,” said
Harrow gloomily. “Better come to the club and give the tickets to the
janitor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s putting it all over Art! If anybody
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<!-- png 073 -->
with earnest eyes tries to speak to us we can call a policeman.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harrow, “on your promise to keep your mouth shut I’ll go
with you. If you open it they’ll discover you’re an appraiser and I’m a
broker, and then they’ll think we’re wealthy, because there’d be no
other reason for our being there, and they’ll touch us both for a brace
of come-ons, and<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” interrupted the other, “we’ll be fortunate enough to sit
next to a peach! And as it’s the proper thing there to talk to your
neighbor, the prospect&mdash;er&mdash;needn’t jar you.”</p>

<p>There was a silence as they walked up-town, which lasted until they
entered their lodgings. And by that time they had concluded
to&nbsp;go.</p>

they went, having nothing better on hand, and at two o’clock they sidled
into the squatty little theater, shyly sought their reserved seats and
sat very still, abashed in the presence of the massed intellects of
Manhattan.</p>

<p>When Clarence Guilford, the Poet of Simplicity, followed by six
healthy, vigorous young daughters, entered the middle aisle of the New
Arts Theater, a number of people whispered in reverent recognition:
“Guilford, the poet! Those are his daughters. They
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<!-- png 075 -->
wear nothing but pink pajamas at home. Sh-sh-h-h!”</p>

<p>Perhaps the poet heard, for he heard a great deal when absent-minded.
He paused; his six tall and blooming daughters, two and two behind him,
very naturally paused also, because the poet was bulky and the aisle
narrow.</p>

<p>Those of the elect who had recognized him had now an opportunity to
view him at close range; young women with expressive eyes leaned
forward, quivering; several earnest young men put up lorgnettes.</p>

<p>It was as it should have been; and the poet stood motionless in
dreamy abstraction, until an usher took his coupons and turned down
seven seats. Then the six daughters filed in, and the poet, slowly
turning to survey the house, started slightly, as though surprised to
find himself under public scrutiny, passed a large, plump hand over his
forehead, and slowly subsided into the aisle-seat with a smile of
whimsical acquiescence in the knowledge of his own greatness.</p>

<p>“Who,” inquired young Harrow, turning toward Lethbridge&mdash;“who is
that duck?”</p>

<p>“You can search me,” replied Lethbridge in a low voice, “but for
Heaven’s sake <i>look</i>
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<!-- png 076 -->
at those girls! Is it right to bunch such beauty and turn down Senators
from Utah?”</p>

<p>Harrow’s dazzled eyes wandered over the six golden heads and snowy
necks, lovely as six wholesome young goddesses fresh from a bath in the
Hellespont.</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the one next to the one beside you,” whispered Lethbridge,
edging around. “I&nbsp;want to run away with her. Would you mind getting
me a hansom?”</p>

<p>“The one next to me has them all pinched to death,” breathed Harrow
unsteadily. “Look!&mdash;when she isn’t looking. Did you ever see such
eyes and mouth&mdash;such a superb free poise<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh-h-h!” muttered Lethbridge, “the bell-mule is talking to
them.”</p>

<p>“Art,” said the poet, leaning over to look along the line of
fragrant, fresh young beauty, “Art is an art.” With which epigram he
slowly closed his eyes.</p>

<p class = "caption">
He paused; his six tall and blooming daughters<br>
two and two behind him.</p>
<!-- png 078 -->

<p>His daughters looked at him; a young woman expensively but not
smartly gowned bent forward from the row behind. Her attitude was almost
prayerful; her eyes burned.</p>

<p>“Art,” continued the poet, opening his heavy lids with a large, sweet
smile, “Art
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<!-- png 079 -->
is above Art, but Art is never below Art. Art, to be Art, must be
artless. That is a very precious thought&mdash;very, very precious.
Thank you for understanding me&mdash;thank you.” And he included in his
large smile young Harrow, who had been unconsciously bending forward,
hypnotized by the monotonous resonance of the poet’s deep, rich
voice.</p>

<p>Now that the spell was broken, he sank back in his chair, looking at
Lethbridge a little wildly.</p>

<p>“Let me sit next&mdash;after the first act,” began Lethbridge,
coaxing; “they’ll be watching the stage all the first act and you can
look at ’em without being rude, and they’ll do the same next act, and I
can look at ’em, and perhaps they’ll ask us what Art really is<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Did you hear what that man said?” interrupted Harrow, recovering his
voice. “<i>Did</i> you?”</p>

<p>“No; what?”</p>

<p>“Well, listen next time. And all I have to say is, if that
firing-line, with its battery of innocent blue eyes, understands him,
you and I had better apply to the nearest night-school for the rudiments
of an education.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?” began the other
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<!-- png 080 -->
uneasily, when again the poet bent forward to address the firing-line;
and the lovely blue battery turned silently upon the author of their
being.</p>

<p>“Art is the result of a complex mental attitude capable of producing
concrete simplicity.”</p>

<p>“Help!” whispered Harrow, but the poet had caught his eye, and was
fixing the young man with a smile that held him as sirup holds a
fly.</p>

<p>“You ask me what is Art, young sir? Why should I not heed you? Why
should I not answer you? What artificial barriers, falsely called
convention, shall force me to ignore the mute eloquence of your
questioning eyes? You ask me what is Art. I&nbsp;will tell you; it is
<i>this</i>!” And the poet, inverting his thumb, pressed it into the
air. Then, carefully inspecting the dent he had made in the atmosphere,
he erased it with a gesture and folded his arms, looking gravely at
Harrow, whose fascinated eyes protruded.</p>

<p>Behind him Lethbridge whispered hoarsely, “I&nbsp;told you how it
would be in the New Arts Theater. I&nbsp;told you a young man alone was
likely to get spoken to. Now those six girls know you’re a broker!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<!-- png 081 -->
<p>“Don’t say it so loud,” muttered Harrow savagely. “I’m all right so
far, for I haven’t said a word.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not,” returned the other. “I&nbsp;wish that curtain
would go up and stay up. It will be my turn to sit next them after this
act, you know.”</p>

<p>Harrow ventured to glance at the superb young creature sitting beside
him, and at the same instant she looked up and, catching his eye, smiled
in the most innocently friendly fashion&mdash;the direct, clear-eyed
advance of a child utterly unconscious of self.</p>

<p>“I have never before been in a theater,” she said; “have you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon,” stammered Harrow when he found his
voice, “but <i>were</i> you good enough to speak to <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” she said, surprised but amiable; “shouldn’t I have spoken
to you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed&mdash;oh, indeed you should!” said Harrow hastily, with a
quick glance at the poet. The poet, however, appeared to be immersed in
thought, lids partially closed, a benignant smile imprinted on his heavy
features.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> are you doing?” breathed Lethbridge in his ear. Harrow
calmly turned his
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<!-- png 082 -->
back on his closest friend and gazed rapturously at his goddess. And
again her bewildering smile broke out and he fairly blinked in its
glory.</p>

<p>“This is my first play,” she said; “I’m a little excited. I&nbsp;hope
I shall care for&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever seen a play?” asked Harrow, tenderly amazed.</p>

<p>“Never. You see, we always lived in the country, and we have always
been poor until my sister Iole married. And now our father has come to
live with his new son-in-law. So that is how we came to be here in New
York.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>so</i> glad you <i>did</i> come,” said Harrow fervently.</p>

<p>“So are we. We have never before seen anything like a large city. We
have never had enough money to see one. But now that Iole is married,
everything is possible. It is all so interesting for
us&mdash;particularly the clothing. Do you like my gown?”</p>

<p>“It is a dream!” stammered the infatuated youth.</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I think it is wonderful&mdash;but not very
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it fit?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Perfectly; that’s the trouble. It is not
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<!-- png 083 -->
comfortable. We never before were permitted to wear skirts and all sorts
of pretty fluffy frills under them, and <i>such</i> high heels, and
<i>such</i> long stockings, and <i>such</i> tight lacing&mdash;” She
hesitated, then calmly: “But I believe father told us that we are not to
mention our pretty underwear, though it’s hard not to, as it’s the first
we ever had.”</p>

<p>Harrow was past all speech.</p>

<p>“I wish I had my lounging-suit on,” she said with a sigh and a hitch
of her perfectly modeled shoulders.</p>

<p>“W&mdash;what sort of things do you usually dress in?” he
ventured.</p>

<p>“Why, in dress-reform clothes!” she said, laughing. “We never have
worn anything else.”</p>

<p>“Bloomers!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; we had trousers and blouses and
sandals&mdash;something like the pink pajamas we have for night-wear
now. Formerly we wore nothing at night. I&nbsp;am beginning to wonder,
from the way people look at us when we speak of this, whether we were
odd. But all our lives we have never thought about clothing. However,
I&nbsp;am glad you like my new gown, and I fancy I’ll get used to this
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<!-- png 084 -->
tight lacing in time.... What is your name?”</p>

<p>“James Harrow,” he managed to say, aware of an innocence and
directness of thought and speech which were awaking in him faintest
responsive echoes. They were the blessed echoes from the dim, fair land
of childhood, but he did not know&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“James Harrow,” she repeated with a friendly nod. “My name is
Lissa&mdash;my first name; the other is Guilford. My father is the
famous poet, Clarence Guilford. He named us all after
butterflies&mdash;all my sisters”&mdash;counting them on her white
fingers while her eyes rested on him&mdash;“Chlorippe, twelve years old,
that pretty one next to my father; then Philodice, thirteen; Dione,
fourteen; Aphrodite, fifteen; Cybele, the one next to me, sixteen, and
almost seventeen; and myself, seventeen, almost eighteen. Besides, there
is Iole, who married Mr. Wayne, and Vanessa, married to Mr. Briggs. They
have been off on Mr. Wayne’s yacht, the <i>Thendara</i>, on their
wedding trip. Now you know all about us. Do you think you would like to
know&nbsp;us?”</p>

<p>“<i>Like</i> to! I’d simply love to! I<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“That is very nice,” she said unembarrassed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<!-- png 085 -->
<p>“I thought I should like you when I saw you leaning over and
listening so reverently to father’s epigrams. Then, besides, I&nbsp;had
nobody but my sisters to talk to. Oh, you can’t imagine how many
attractive men I see every day in New York&mdash;and I should like to
know them all&mdash;and many <i>do</i> look at me as though they would
like it, too; but Mr. Wayne is so queer, and so are father and Mr.
Briggs&mdash;about my speaking to people in public places. They have
told me not to, but I&mdash;I&mdash;thought I would,” she ended,
smiling. “What harm can it do for me to talk to you?”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly heavenly of you<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think so? I wonder what father thinks”&mdash;turning to
look; then, resuming: “He generally makes us stop, but I am quite sure
he expected me to talk to you.”</p>

<p>The lone note of a piano broke the thread of the sweetest, maddest
discourse Harrow had ever listened to; the girl’s cheeks flushed and she
turned expectantly toward the curtained stage. Again the lone note,
thumped vigorously, sounded a <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘stacatto’">staccato</ins> monotone.</p>

<p>“Precious&mdash;very precious,” breathed the poet, closing his eyes
in a sort of fatty ecstasy.</p>

looked at his program, then, leaning toward Lissa, whispered: “That is
the overture to <i>Attitudes</i>&mdash;the program explains it: ‘A
series of pale gray notes’&mdash;what the deuce!&mdash;‘pale <i>gray</i>
notes giving the value of the highest light in which the play is
pitched’&mdash;” He paused, aghast.</p>

<p>“I understand,” whispered the girl, resting her lovely arm on the
chair beside him. “Look! The curtain is rising! <i>How</i> my heart
beats! Does yours?”</p>

<p>He nodded, unable to articulate.</p>

<p>The curtain rose very, very slowly, upon the first scene of Barnard
Haw’s masterpiece of satire; and the lovely firing-line quivered, blue
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<!-- png 087 -->
batteries opening very wide, lips half parted in breathless
anticipation. And about that time Harrow almost expired as a soft,
impulsive hand closed nervously over his.</p>

<p>And there, upon the stage, the human species was delicately
vivisected in one act; human frailty exposed, human motives detected,
human desire quenched in all the brilliancy of perverted epigram and the
scalpel analysis of the astigmatic. Life, love, and folly were portrayed
with the remorseless accuracy of an eye doubly sensitive through the
stimulus of an intellectual strabismus. Barnard Haw at his greatest! And
how he dissected attitudes; the attitude assumed by the lover, the
father, the wife, the daughter, the mother, the mistress&mdash;proving
that virtue, <i>per se</i>, is a pose. Attitudes! How he flayed those
who assumed them. His attitude toward attitudes was remorseless,
uncompromising, inexorable.</p>

<p>And the curtain fell on the first act, its gray and silver folds
swaying in the half-crazed whirlwind of applause.</p>

<p>Lissa’s silky hand trembled in Harrow’s, her grasp relaxed. He
dropped his hand and, searching, encountered hers again.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> do you think of it?” she asked.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<!-- png 088 -->
<p>“I don’t think there’s any harm in it,” he stammered guiltily,
supposing she meant the contact of their interlaced fingers.</p>

<p>“Harm? I didn’t mean harm,” she said. “The play is perfectly
harmless, I&nbsp;think.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;the play! Oh, that’s just <i>that</i> sort of play, you
know. They’re all alike; a lot of people go about telling each other how
black white is and that white is always black&mdash;until somebody
suddenly discovers that black and white are a sort of greenish red. Then
the audience applauds frantically in spite of the fact that everybody in
it had concluded that black and white were really a shade of yellowish
yellow!”</p>

<p>She had begun to laugh; and as he proceeded, excited by her approval,
the most adorable gaiety possessed her.</p>

<p>“I <i>never</i> heard anything half so clever!” she said, leaning
toward him.</p>

<p>“I? Clever!” he faltered. “You&mdash;you don’t really mean that!”</p>

<p>“Why? Don’t you know you are? Don’t you know in your heart that you
have said the very thing that I in my heart found no words to
explain?”</p>

<p>“Did I, really?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<!-- png 089 -->
<p>“Yes. Isn’t it delightful!”</p>

<p>It was; Harrow, holding tightly to the soft little hand half hidden
by the folds of her gown, cast a sneaking look behind him, and
encountered the fixed and furious glare of his closest friend, who had
pinched him.</p>

<p>“Pig!” hissed Lethbridge, “do I sit next or not?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t; I’ll explain<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> I?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I understand <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. Lissa and I<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Lissa!”</p>

<p>“Ya&mdash;as! We’re talking very cleverly; <i>I</i> am, too.
Wha’d’you wan’ to butt in for?” with sudden venom.</p>

<p>“Butt in! Do you think I want to sit here and look at tha’ damfool
play! Fix it or I’ll run about biting!”</p>

<p>Harrow turned. “Lissa,” he whispered in an exquisitely modulated
voice, “what would happen if I spoke to your sister Cybele?”</p>

<p>“Why, she’d answer you, silly!” said the girl, laughing. “Wouldn’t
you, Cybele?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’d like to do,” said Cybele,
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<!-- png 090 -->
leaning forward: “I’d like very much to talk to that attractive man who
is trying to look at me&mdash;only your head has been in the way.” And
she smiled innocently at Lethbridge.</p>

<p>So Lissa moved down one. Harrow took her seat, and Cybele dropped
gaily into Harrow’s vacant place.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>,” she said to Lethbridge, “we can tell each other all
sorts of things. I&nbsp;was so glad that you looked at me all the while
and so vexed that I couldn’t talk to you. <i>How</i> do you like my new
gown? And what is your name? Have you ever before seen a play?
I&nbsp;haven’t, and my name is Cybele.”</p>

<p>“It is per&mdash;perfectly heavenly to hear you talk,” stammered
Lethbridge.</p>

<p>Harrow heard him, turned and looked him full in the eyes, then slowly
resumed his attitude of attention: for the poet was speaking:</p>

<p>“The Art of Barnard Haw is the quintessence of simplicity. What is
the quintessence of simplicity?” He lifted one heavy pudgy hand, joined
the tips of his soft thumb and forefinger, and selecting an atom of air,
deftly
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<!-- png 091 -->
captured it. “<i>That</i> is the quintessence of simplicity; <i>that</i>
is Art!”</p>

<p>He smiled largely on Harrow, whose eyes had become wild again.</p>

<p>“<i>That!</i>” he repeated, pinching out another molecule of
atmosphere, “and <i>that</i>!” punching dent after dent in the viewless
void with inverted thumb.</p>

<p>On the hapless youth the overpowering sweetness of his smile acted
like an anesthetic; he saw things waver, even wabble; and his hidden
clutch on Lissa’s fingers tightened spasmodically.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the poet, leaning forward to fix the young man with
his heavy-lidded eyes. “Thank you for the precious thoughts you inspire
in me. Bless you. Our mental and esthetic commune has been very precious
to me&mdash;very, very precious,” he mooned bulkily, his rich voice
dying to a resonant, soothing drone.</p>

<p>Lissa turned to the petrified young man. “Please be clever some
more,” she whispered. “You were so perfectly delightful about this
play.”</p>

<p>“Child!” he groaned, “I have scarcely sufficient intellect to keep me
overnight. You
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<!-- png 092 -->
must know that I haven’t understood one single thing your father has
been kind enough to say.”</p>

<p>“What didn’t you understand?” she asked, surprised.</p>

<p>“’<i>That!</i>’” He flourished his thumb. “What does ’<i>That!</i>’
mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is only a trick father has caught from painters who tell
you how they’re going to use their brushes. But the truth is I’ve
usually noticed that they do most of their work in the air with their
thumbs.... What else did you not understand?”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;Art!” he said wearily. “What is it? Or, as Barnard Haw, the
higher exponent of the Webberfield philosophy, might say: ‘What it iss?
Yess?’”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the Webberfield philosophy is,” said Lissa
innocently, “but Art is only things one believes. And it’s awfully hard,
too, because nobody sees the same thing in the same way, or believes the
same things that others believe. So there are all kinds of Art.
I&nbsp;think the only way to be sure is when the artist makes himself
and his audience happier; then that is Art.... But one need not use
one’s thumb, you know.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<!-- png 093 -->
<p>“The&mdash;the way you make me happy? Is <i>that</i> Art?”</p>

<p>“Do I?” she laughed. “Perhaps; for I am happy, too&mdash;far, far
happier than when I read the works of Henry Haynes. And Henry Haynes
<i>is</i> Art. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>But Harrow knew nothing of the intellectual obstetrics which produced
that great master’s monotypes.</p>

<p>“Have you read Double or Quits?” he ventured shyly. “It’s a humming
Wall Street story showing up the entire bunch and exposing the
trading-stamp swindle of the great department stores. The heroine is a
detective and&mdash;” She was looking at him so intently that he feared
he had said something he shouldn’t. “But I don’t suppose that would
interest you,” he muttered, ashamed.</p>

<p>“It does! It is <i>new</i>! I&mdash;I never read that sort of a
novel. Tell&nbsp;me!”</p>

<p>“Are you serious?”</p>

<p>“Of course. It is perfectly wonderful to think of a heroine being a
detective.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s a dream!” he said with cautious enthusiasm. “She falls in
love with the worst stock-washer in Wall Street, and pushes him off a
ferry-boat when she finds he has cornered

of the department store trust<span class =

<p>“Go on!” she whispered breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I will, but<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“What is it? Oh&mdash;is it my hand you are looking for? Here it is;
I&nbsp;only wanted to smooth my hair a moment. Now tell me; for I never,
never knew that such books were written. The books my father permits us
to read are not concerned with all those vital episodes of every-day
life. Nobody ever <i>does</i> anything in the few novels I am allowed to
read&mdash;except, once, in <i>Cranford</i>, somebody gets up out of a
chair in one chapter&mdash;but sits down again in the next,” she added
wearily.</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll</i> send you something to make anybody sit up and stay up,”
he said indignantly. “Baffles, the Gent Burglar; Love Militant, by Nora
Norris Newman; The Crown-Snatcher, by Reginald Rodman Roony&mdash;oh,
it’s simply ghastly to think of what you’ve missed! This is the
Victorian era; you have a right to be fully cognizant of the great
literary movements of the twentieth century!”</p>

<p>“I love to hear you say such things,” she said, her beautiful face
afire. “I&nbsp;desire to be
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<!-- png 095 -->
modern&mdash;intensely, humanly modern. All my life I have been
nourished on the classics of ages dead; the literature of the Orient, of
Asia, of Europe I am familiar with; the literature of England&mdash;as
far as Andrew Bang’s boyhood verses. I&mdash;all my sisters&mdash;read,
write, speak, even think, in ten languages. I&nbsp;long for something to
read which is vital, familiar, friendly&mdash;something of my own time,
my own day. I&nbsp;wish to know what young people do and dare; what they
really think, what they believe, strive for, desire!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well, I don’t think people really do and say and think
the things that you read in interesting modern novels,” he said
doubtfully. “Fact is, only the tiresome novels seem to tell a portion of
the truth; but they end by overdoing it and leave you yawning with a
nasty taste in your mouth. I&mdash;I think you’d better let your father
pick out your novels.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” she said rebelliously. “I&nbsp;want
<i>you</i>&nbsp;to.”</p>

<p>He looked at the beautiful, rebellious face and took a closer hold on
the hidden hand.</p>

<p>“I wish you&mdash;I wish I could choose&mdash;everything for you,” he
said unsteadily.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<!-- png 096 -->
<p>“I wish so, too. You are exactly the sort of man I like.”</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” she replied, opening her splendid eyes. “Don’t I show the
pleasure I take in being with you?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;would you tire of me if&mdash;if we
always&mdash;forever<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Were friends? No.”</p>

<p>“Mo-m-m-more than friends?” Then he choked.</p>

<p>The speculation in her wide eyes deepened. “What do you mean?” she
asked curiously.</p>

<p>But again the lone note of the thumped piano signaled silence. In the
sudden hush the poet opened his lids with a sticky smile and folded his
hands over his abdomen, plump thumbs joined.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> do you mean?” repeated Lissa hurriedly, tightening her
slender fingers around Harrow’s.</p>

<p>“I mean&mdash;I mean<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He turned in silence and their eyes met. A&nbsp;moment later her
fingers relaxed limply in his; their hands were still in
contact&mdash;but scarcely so; and so remained while the
<i>Attitudes</i> of Barnard Haw held the stage.</p>

was a young wife behind the footlights explaining to a young man who was
not her husband that her marriage vows need not be too seriously
considered if he, the young man, found them too inconvenient. Which
scared the young man, who was plainly a purveyor of heated air and a
short sport. And, although she explained very clearly that if he needed
her in his business he had better say so quick, the author’s invention
gave out just there and he called in the young wife’s husband to help
him out.</p>

<p>And all the while the battery of round blue
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<!-- png 098 -->
eyes gazed on unwinking; the poet’s dewlaps quivered with stored
emotion, and the spellbound audience breathed as people breathe when the
hostess at table attempts to smooth over a bad break by her husband.</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> life?” whispered Cybele to Lethbridge, her sensitive
mouth aquiver. “Did the author actually know such people? Do <i>you</i>?
Is conscience really only an attitude? Is instinct the only guide? Am
<i>I</i>&mdash;really&mdash;bad<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“No, no,” whispered Lethbridge; “all that is only a dramatist’s
attitude. Don’t&mdash;don’t look grieved! Why, every now and then some
man discovers he can attract more attention by standing on his head.
That is all&mdash;really, that is all. Barnard Haw on his feet is not
amusing; but the same gentleman on his head is worth an orchestra-chair.
When a man wears his trousers where other men wear their coats, people
are bound to turn around. It is not a new trick. Mystes, the Argive
comic poet, and the White Queen, taught this author the value of
substituting ‘is’ for ‘is not,’ until, from standing so long inverted,
he himself forgets what he means, and at this point the eminent brothers
Rogers take up the important work....
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<!-- png 099 -->
Please, please, Cybele, <i>don’t</i> take it seriously!... If you look
that way&mdash;if you are unhappy, I&mdash;I<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>A gentle snore from the poet transfixed the firing-line, but the
snore woke up the poet and he mechanically pinched an atom out of the
atmosphere, blinking at the stage.</p>

<p>“Precious&mdash;very, very precious,” he murmured drowsily. “Thank
you&mdash;thank everybody&mdash;” And he sank into an obese and
noiseless slumber as the gray and silver curtain slowly fell. The
applause, far from rousing him, merely soothed him; a honeyed smile
hovered on his lips which formed the words “Thank you.” That was all;
the firing-line stirred, breathed deeply, and folded twelve soft white
hands. Chlorippe, twelve, and Philodice, thirteen, yawned, pink-mouthed,
sleepy-eyed; Dione, fourteen, laid her golden head on the shoulder of
Aphrodite, fifteen.</p>

<p>The finger-tips of Lissa and Harrow still touched, scarcely clinging;
they had turned toward one another when the curtain fell. But the play,
to them, had been a pantomime of silhouettes, the stage, a void edged
with flame&mdash;the scene, the audience, the theater, the poet himself
as unreal and meaningless as the shadowy
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<!-- png 100 -->
attitudes of the shapes that vanished when the phantom curtain closed
its folds.</p>

<p>And through the subdued light, turning noiselessly, they peered at
one another, conscious that naught else was real in the misty,
golden-tinted gloom; that they were alone together there in a formless,
soundless chaos peopled by shapes impalpable as dreams.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> tell me,” she said, her lips scarcely moving as the soft
voice stirred them like carmine petals stirring in a scented breeze.</p>

<p>“Tell you that it is&mdash;love?”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell me.”</p>

<p>“That I love you, Lissa?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that!”</p>

<p>He stooped nearer; his voice was steady and very low, and she leaned
with bent head to listen, clear-eyed, intelligent, absorbed.</p>

<p>“So <i>that</i> is love&mdash;what you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;partly.”</p>

<p>“And the other part?”</p>

<p>“The other part is when you find you love&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;do. I think it must be love, because I can’t bear to have
you go away. Besides, I&nbsp;wish you to tell me&mdash;things.”</p>

<p>“Ask me.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<!-- png 101 -->
<p>“Well&mdash;when two&mdash;like you and me, begin to love&mdash;what
happens?”</p>

<p>“We confess it<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I do; I’m not ashamed.... Should I be? And then?”</p>

<p>“Then?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Yes; do we kiss?... For I am curious to have you do it&mdash;I am so
certain I shall adore you when you do.... I&nbsp;wish we could go away
somewhere together.... But we can’t do that until I am a bride, can we?
Oh&mdash;do you really want&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Can you ask?” he breathed.</p>

<p>“Ask? Yes&mdash;yes.... I love to ask! Your hand thrills me. We can’t
go away now, can we? It took Iole so long to be permitted to go away
with Mr. Wayne&mdash;all that time lost in so many foolish
ways&mdash;when a girl is so impatient.... Is it not strange how my
heart beats when I look into your eyes? Oh, there can be no doubt about
it, I&nbsp;am dreadfully in love.... And so quickly, too. I&nbsp;suppose
it’s because I am in such splendid health; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;well<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <i>do</i> want to get up at once and go
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<!-- png 102 -->
away with you! <i>Can’t</i> we? I&nbsp;could explain to father.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” he gasped, “he&mdash;he’s asleep. Don’t speak&mdash;don’t
touch him.”</p>

<p>“How unselfish you are,” she breathed. “No, you are not hurting my
fingers. Tell me more&mdash;about love and the blessed years awaiting
us, and about our children&mdash;oh, is it not wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Ex&mdash;extremely,” he managed to mutter, touching his suddenly
dampened forehead with his handkerchief, and attempting to set his
thoughts in some sort of order. He could not; the incoherence held him
speechless, dazed, under the magic of this superb young being instinct
with the soft fire of life.</p>

<p>Her loveliness, her innocence, the beautiful, direct gaze, the
childlike fulness of mouth and contour of cheek and throat, left him
spellbound. The very air around them seemed suffused with the vital glow
of her youth and beauty; each breath they drew increased their wonder,
till the whole rosy universe seemed thrilling and singing at their feet,
and they two, love-crowned, alone, saw Time and Eternity flowing like a
golden tide under the spell of Paradise.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<!-- png 103 -->
<p>“Jim!”</p>

<p>The hoarse whisper of Lethbridge shook the vision from him; he turned
a flushed countenance to his friend; but Cybele spoke:</p>

<p>“We are very tired sitting here. We would like to take some tea at
Sherry’s,” she whispered. “What do you think we had better do? It seems
so&mdash;so futile to sit here&mdash;when we wish to be alone
together<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“You and Henry, too!” gasped Harrow.</p>

<p>“Yes; do you wonder?” She leaned swiftly in front of him; a fragrant
breeze stirred his hair. “Lissa, I’m desperately infatuated with Mr.
Lethbridge. Do you see any use in our staying here when I’m simply dying
to have him all to myself somewhere?”</p>

<p>“No, it is silly. I wish to go, too. Shall&nbsp;we?”</p>

<p>“You need not go,” began Cybele; then stopped, aware of the new magic
in her sister’s eyes. “Lissa! Lissa!” she said softly. “<i>You</i>, too!
Oh, my dear&mdash;my dearest!”</p>

<p>“Dear, is it not heavenly? I&mdash;I&mdash;was quite sure that if I
ever had a good chance to talk to a man I really liked something would
happen. And it has.”</p>

<p>“If Philodice might awaken father perhaps he would let us go now,”
whispered Cybele.
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<!-- png 104 -->
“Henry says it does not take more than an hour<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“To become a bride?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he knows a clergyman very near<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Do you?” inquired Lissa. Lethbridge nodded and gave a scared glance
at Harrow, who returned it as though stunned.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but,” muttered the latter, “your father doesn’t know who
we are<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he does,” said Cybele calmly, “for he sent you the tickets
and placed us near you so that if we found that we liked you we might
talk to you<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Only he made a mistake in your name,” added Lissa to Harrow, “for he
wrote ‘Stanley West, Esq.’ on the envelope. I&nbsp;know because I
mailed&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“Invited West&mdash;put <i>you</i> where you could&mdash;good
God!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” whispered Lissa in consternation;
“have&mdash;have I said anything I should not?” And, as he was silent:
“What is it? Have I hurt you&mdash;I who<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>There was a silence; she looked him through and through and, after a
while, deep, deep in his soul, she saw, awaking once again, all he
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<!-- png 105 -->
had deemed dead&mdash;the truth, the fearless reason, the sweet and
faultless instinct of the child whose childhood had become a memory.
Then, once more spiritually equal, they smiled at one another; and
Lissa, pausing to gather up her ermine stole, passed noiselessly out to
the aisle, where she stood, perfectly self-possessed, while her sister
joined her, smiling vaguely down at the firing-line and their lifted
battery of blue, inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>The poet&mdash;and whether he had slumbered or not nobody but himself
is qualified to judge&mdash;the poet pensively opened one eye and peeped
at Harrow as that young man bent beside him with Lethbridge at his
elbow.</p>

<p>“In sending those two tickets you have taught us a new creed,”
whispered Harrow; “you have taught us innocence and simplicity&mdash;you
have taught us to be ourselves, to scorn convention, to say and do what
we believe. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Dear friend,” said the poet in an artistically-modulated whisper,
“I&nbsp;have long, long followed you in the high course of your career.
To me the priceless simplicity of poverty: to you the responsibility for
millions. To me the daisy, the mountain stream, the woodchuck
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<!-- png 106 -->
and my Art! To you the busy mart, the haunts of men, the ship of finance
laden with a nation’s wealth, the awful burden of millions for which you
are answerable to One higher!” He raised one soft, solemn finger.</p>

<p>The young men gazed at one another, astounded. Lethbridge’s startled
eyes said, “He still takes you for Stanley West!”</p>

<p>“Let him!” flashed the grim answer back from the narrowing gaze of
Harrow.</p>

<p>“Daughters,” whispered the poet playfully, “are you so soon tired of
the brilliant gems of satire which our master dramatist scatters with a
lavish<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cybele; “we are only very much in love.”</p>

<p>The poet sat up briskly and looked hard at Harrow.</p>

<p>“Your&mdash;your friend?” he began&mdash;“doubtless associated with
you in the high<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“We are inseparable,” said Harrow calmly, “in the busy marts.”</p>

<p>The sweetness of the poet’s smile was almost overpowering.</p>

<p>“To discuss this sudden&mdash;ah&mdash;condition which
so&mdash;ah&mdash;abruptly confronts a father, I&nbsp;can not welcome
you to my little home in the
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<!-- png 107 -->
wild&mdash;which I call the House Beautiful,” he said. “I&nbsp;would it
were possible. There all is quiet and simple and exquisitely
humble&mdash;though now, through the grace of my valued son, there is no
mortgage hanging like the brand of Damocles above our lowly roof. But I
bid you welcome in the name of my son-in-law, on whom&mdash;I should
say, <i>with</i> whom&mdash;I and my babes are sojourning in this
clamorous city. Come and let us talk, soul to soul, heart to heart; come
and partake of what simples we have. Set the day, the hour. I&nbsp;thank
you for understanding&nbsp;me<ins class = "correction" title = "text has extra single quote">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“The hour,” replied Harrow, “will be about five <span class =
"smallroman">P.M.</span> on Monday afternoon.... You see, we are going
out now to&mdash;to<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“To marry each other,” whispered Lissa with all her sweet
fearlessness. “Oh, dear! there goes that monotonous piano and we’ll be
blocking people’s view!”</p>

<p>The poet tried to rise upon his great flat feet, but he was wedged
too tightly; he strove to speak, to call after them, but the loud
thumping notes of the piano drowned his voice.</p>

<p>“Chlorippe! Dione! Philodice! Tell them to stop! Run after them and
stay them!” panted the poet.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<!-- png 108 -->
<p>“<i>You</i> go!” pouted Dione.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to,” explained Chlorippe, “because the curtain is
rising.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” sighed Philodice, rising to her slender height and moving
up the aisle as the children of queens moved once upon a time. She came
back presently, saying: “Dear me, they’re dreadfully in love, and they
have driven away in two hansoms.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” wheezed the poet.</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Philodice, staring at the stage and calmly folding her
smooth little hands.</p>

the curtain at last descended upon the parting attitudes of the players
the poet arose with an alacrity scarcely to be expected in a gentleman
of his proportions. Two and two his big, healthy daughters&mdash;there
remained but four now&mdash;followed him to the lobby. When he was able
to pack all four into a cab he did so and sent them home without
ceremony; then, summoning another vehicle, gave the driver the
directions and climbed&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was deposited under the bronze shelter of the
porte-cochère belonging
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<!-- png 110 -->
to an extremely expensive mansion overlooking the park; and presently,
admitted, he prowled ponderously and softly about an over-gilded rococo
reception-room. But all anxiety had now fled from his face; he coyly
nipped the atmosphere at intervals as various portions of the furniture
attracted his approval; he stood before a splendid canvas of Goya and
pushed his thumb at it; he moused and prowled and peeped and snooped,
and his smile grew larger and larger and sweeter and sweeter,
until&mdash;dare I say it!&mdash;a low smooth chuckle, all but
noiseless, rippled the heavy cheeks of the poet; and, raising his eyes,
he beheld a stocky, fashionably-dressed and red-faced man of forty
intently eying him. The man spoke decisively and at once:</p>

<p>“Mr. Guilford? Quite so. I am Mr. West.”</p>

<p>“You are&mdash;” The poet’s smile flickered like a sickly candle.
“I&mdash;this is&mdash;are you Mr. <i>Stanley</i> West?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“It must&mdash;it probably was your son<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I am unmarried,” said the president of the Occidental tartly, “and
the only Stanley West in the directory.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<!-- png 111 -->
<p>The poet swayed, then sat down rather suddenly on a Louis XIV chair
which crackled. Several times he passed an ample hand over his features.
A&nbsp;mechanical smile struggled to break out, but it was not
<i>the</i> smile, any more than glucose is sugar.</p>

<p>“Did&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>did</i> you receive two tickets for the New
Arts Theater&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr. West?” he managed to say at last.</p>

<p>“I did. Thank you very much, but I was not able to avail myself<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Quite so. And&mdash;ah&mdash;do you happen to know who it was
that&mdash;ah&mdash;presented your tickets and occupied the seats this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose it was two young men in our employ&mdash;Mr.
Lethbridge, who appraises property for us, and Mr. Harrow, one of our
brokers. May I ask why?”</p>

<p>For a long while the poet sat there, eyes squeezed tightly closed as
though in bodily anguish. Then he opened one of them:</p>

<p>“They are&mdash;ah&mdash;quite penniless, I presume?”</p>

<p>“They have prospects,” said West briefly. “Why?”</p>

<p>The poet rose; something of his old attitude
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<!-- png 112 -->
returned; he feebly gazed at a priceless Massero vase, made a
half-hearted attempt to join thumb and forefinger, then rambled toward
the door, where two spotless flunkies attended with his hat and
overcoat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guilford,” said West, following, a trifle perplexed and
remorseful, “I&nbsp;should be very&mdash;er&mdash;extremely happy to
subscribe to the New Arts Theater&mdash;if that is what you wished.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the poet absently as a footman invested him with a
seal-lined coat.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more I could do for you, Mr. Guilford?”</p>

<p>The poet’s abstracted gaze rested on him, then shifted.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t feel very well,” said the poet hoarsely, sitting
down in a hall-seat. Suddenly he began to cry, fatly.</p>

<p>Nobody did anything; the stupefied footman gaped; West looked, walked
nervously the length of the hall, looked again, and paced the inlaid
floor to and fro, until the bell at the door sounded and a messenger-boy
appeared with a note scribbled on a yellow telegraph blank:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<!-- png 113 -->
<p class = "space">
“Lethbridge and I just married and madly happy. Will be on hand Monday,
sure. Can’t you advance us three months’ salary?</p>

<p class = "righthalf smallcaps">“Harrow.”</p>

<p>“Idiots!” said West. Then, looking up: “What are you waiting for,
boy?”</p>

<p>“Me answer,” replied the messenger calmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you were told to bring back an answer?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as.”</p>

<p>“Then give me your pencil, my infant Chesterfield.” And West
scribbled on the same yellow blank:</p>

<p class = "space">
“Checks for you on your desks Monday. Congratulations. I’ll see you
through, you damfools.</p>

<p class = "righthalf smallcaps">“West.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a quarter for you,” observed West, eying the messenger.</p>

<p>“T’anks. Gimme the note.”</p>

<p>West glanced at the moist, fat poet; then suddenly that intuition
which is bred in men of his stamp set him thinking. And presently he
tentatively added two and two.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guilford,” he said, “I wonder
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<!-- png 114 -->
whether this note&mdash;and my answer to it&mdash;concerns you.”</p>

<p>The poet used his handkerchief, adjusted a pair of glasses, and
blinked at the penciled scrawl. Twice he read it; then, like the full
sun breaking through a drizzle&mdash;like the glory of a search-light
dissolving a sticky fog, <i>the</i> smile of smiles illuminated
everything: footmen, messenger, financier.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said thickly; “thank you for your thought. Thought is
but a trifle to bestow&mdash;a little thing in itself. But it is the
little things that are most important&mdash;the smaller the thing the
more vital its importance, until”&mdash;he added in a genuine burst of
his old eloquence&mdash;“the thing becomes so small that it isn’t
anything at all, and then the value of nothing becomes so enormous that
it is past all computation. That is a very precious thought! Thank you
for it; thank you for understanding. Bless you!”</p>

<p>Exuding a rich sweetness from every feature the poet moved toward the
door at a slow fleshy waddle, head wagging, small eyes half closed,
thumbing the atmosphere, while his lips moved in wordless
self-communion: “The attainment of nothing at all&mdash;that is rarest,
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<!-- png 115 -->
the most precious, the most priceless of triumphs&mdash;very, very
precious. So”&mdash;and his glance was sideways and nimbly
intelligent&mdash;“so if nothing at all is of such inestimable value,
those two young pups can live on their expectations&mdash;<i>quod erat
demonstrandum</i>.”</p>

<p>He shuddered and looked up at the façade of the gorgeous house which
he had just quitted.</p>

<p>“So many sunny windows to sit in&mdash;to dream in. I&mdash;I should
have found it agreeable. Pups!”</p>

<p>Crawling into his cab he sank into a pulpy mound, partially closing
his eyes. And upon his pursed-up lips, unuttered yet imminent, a word
trembled and wabbled as the cab bounced down the avenue. It may have
been “precious”; it was probably “pups!”</p>

there were further poignant emotions in store for the poet, for, as his
cab swung out of the avenue and drew up before the great house on the
southwest corner of Seventy-ninth Street and Madison Avenue, he caught a
glimpse of his eldest daughter, Iole, vanishing into the house, and, at
the same moment, he perceived his son-in-law, Mr. Wayne, paying the
driver of a hansom-cab, while several liveried servants bore houseward
the luggage of the wedding journey.</p>

<p>“George!” he cried dramatically, thrusting his head from the window
of his own cab as that vehicle drew up with a jolt that made his stomach
vibrate, “George! I&nbsp;am here!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<!-- png 117 -->
<p>Wayne looked around, paid the hansom-driver, and, advancing slowly,
offered his hand as the poet descended to the sidewalk. “How are you?”
he inquired without enthusiasm as the poet evinced a desire to paw him.
“All is well here, I&nbsp;hope.”</p>

<p>“George! Son!” The poet gulped till his dewlap contracted. He laid a
large plump hand on Wayne’s shoulders. “Where are my lambs?” he
quavered; “where are they?”</p>

<p>“Which lambs?” inquired the young man uneasily. “If you mean Iole and
Vanessa<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“No! My ravished lambs! Give me my stolen lambs. Trifle no longer
with a father’s affections! Lissa!&mdash;Cybele! Great Heavens! Where
are they?” he sobbed hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>where</i> are they?” retorted his son-in-law, horrified.
“Come into the house; people in the street are looking.”</p>

<p>In the broad hall the poet paused, staggered, strove to paw Wayne,
then attempted to fold his arms in an attitude of bitter scorn.</p>

<p>“Two penniless wastrels,” he muttered, “are wedded to my lambs. But
there are laws to invoke<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>An avalanche of pretty girls in pink pajamas
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<!-- png 118 -->
came tumbling down the bronze and marble staircase, smothering poet and
son-in-law in happy embraces; and “Oh, George!” they cried, “how
sunburned you are! So is Iole, but she is too sweet! Did you have a
perfectly lovely honeymoon? When is Vanessa coming? And how is Mr.
Briggs? And&mdash;oh, do you know the news? Cybele and Lissa married two
such extremely attractive young men this afternoon<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Married!” cried Wayne, releasing Dione’s arms from his neck.
“<i>Whom</i> did they marry?”</p>

<p>“Pups!” sniveled the poet&mdash;“penniless, wastrel pups!”</p>

<p>“Their names,” said Aphrodite coolly, from the top of the staircase,
“are James Harrow and Henry Lethbridge. I&nbsp;wish there had been
three<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Harrow! Lethbridge!” gasped Wayne. “When”&mdash;he turned helplessly
to the poet&mdash;“when did they do this?”</p>

<p>Through the gay babble of voices and amid cries and interruptions,
Wayne managed to comprehend the story. He tried to speak, but everybody
except the poet laughed and chatted, and the poet, suffused now with a
sort of sad sweetness, waved his hand in slow
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<!-- png 119 -->
unctuous waves until even the footmen’s eyes protruded.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Wayne, raising his voice; “it’s topsyturvy and
irregular, but it’s all right. I’ve known Harrow and Leth&mdash;For
Heaven’s sake, Dione, don’t kiss me like that; I&nbsp;want to
talk!&mdash;You’re hugging me too hard, Philodice. Oh, Lord! <i>will</i>
you stop chattering all together! I&mdash;I&mdash;Do you want the house
to be pinched?”</p>

<p>He glanced up at Aphrodite, who sat astride the banisters lighting a
cigarette. “Who taught you to do that?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I’m sixteen, now,” she said coolly, “and I thought I’d
try&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Her voice was drowned in the cries and laughter; Wayne, with his
hands to his ears, stared up at the piquant figure in its pink pajamas
and sandals, then his distracted gaze swept the groups of parlor maids
and footmen around the doors: “Great guns!” he thundered, “this is the
limit and they’ll pull the house! Morton!”&mdash;to a
footman&mdash;“ring up 7&mdash;00&mdash;9B Murray Hill. My compliments
and congratulations to Mr. Lethbridge and to Mr. Harrow, and say that we
usually dine at eight! Philodice! stop that howling!&nbsp;Oh,
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<!-- png 120 -->
just you wait until Iole has a talk with you all for running about the
house half-dressed<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I <i>won’t</i> wear straight fronts indoors, and my garters hurt!”
cried Aphrodite defiantly, preparing to slide down the banisters.</p>

<p>“Help!” said Wayne faintly, looking from Dione to Chlorippe, from
Chlorippe to Philodice, from Philodice to Aphrodite. “I&nbsp;won’t have
my house turned into a confounded Art Nouveau music hall. I&nbsp;tell
you<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Let <i>me</i> tell them,” said Iole, laughing and kissing her hand
to the poet as she descended the stairs in her pretty bride’s traveling
gown.</p>

<p>She checked Aphrodite, looked wisely around at her lovely sisters,
then turned to remount the stairs, summoning them with a gay little
confidential gesture.</p>

<p>And when the breathless crew had trooped after her, and the pad of
little, eager, sandaled feet had died away on the thick rugs of the
landing above, the poet, clasping his fat white hands, thumbs joined,
across his rotund abdomen, stole a glance at his dazed son-in-law, which
was partly apprehensive and partly significant, almost cunning. “An
innocent saturnalia,” he murmured. “The charming abandon of children.”
He unclasped one
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<!-- png 121 -->
hand and waved it. “Did you note the unstudied beauty of the composition
as my babes glided in and out following the natural and archaic yet
exquisitely balanced symmetry of the laws which govern mass and line
composition, all unconsciously, yet perhaps”&mdash;he reversed his thumb
and left his sign manual upon the atmosphere&mdash;“perhaps,” he mused,
overflowing with sweetness&mdash;“perhaps the laws of Art Nouveau are
divine!&mdash;perhaps angels and cherubim, unseen, watch fondly o’er my
babes, lest all unaware they guiltlessly violate some subtle canon of
Art, marring the perfect symmetry of eternal preciousness.”</p>

<p>Wayne’s mouth was partly open, his eyes hopeless yet fixed upon the
poet with a fearful fascination.</p>

<p>“Art,” breathed the poet, “is a solemn, a fearful responsibility.
<i>You</i> are responsible, George, and some day you must answer for
every violation of Art, to the eternal outraged fitness of things.
<i>You</i> must answer, <i>I</i> must answer, every soul must
answer!”</p>

<p>“A-ans&mdash;answer! What, for God’s sake?” stammered Wayne.</p>

<p>The poet, deliberately joining thumb and
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<!-- png 122 -->
forefinger, pinched out a portion of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“That! <i>That</i> George! For that is Art! And Art is justice! And
justice, affronted, demands an answer.”</p>

<p>He refolded his arms, mused for a space, then stealing a veiled
glance sideways:</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you are&mdash;ah&mdash;convinced that my two lost lambs
need dread no bodily vicissitudes<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Cybele and Lissa?”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;yes<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Lethbridge will have money to burn if he likes the aroma of the
smoke. Harrow has burnt several stacks already; but his father will
continue to fire the furnace. Is <i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p>“No!” said the poet softly, “no, George, that is not what I mean.
Wealth is a great thing. Only the little things are precious to me. And
the most precious of all is absolutely nothing!” But, as he wandered
away into the great luxurious habitation of his son-in-law, his smile
grew sweeter and sweeter and his half-closed eyes swam, melting into a
saccharine reverie.</p>

<p>“The little things,” he murmured, thumbing
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<!-- png 123 -->
the air absently&mdash;“the little things are precious, but not as
precious as absolutely nothing. For nothing is perfection. Thank you,”
he said sweetly to a petrified footman, “thank you for understanding. It
is precious&mdash;very, very precious to know that I am understood.”</p>

early springtide the poet had taken an old-fashioned house on the south
side of Washington Square; his sons-in-law standing for it&mdash;as the
poet was actually beginning to droop amid the civilized luxury of
Madison Avenue. He missed what he called his own “den.” So he got it,
rent free, and furnished it sparingly with furniture of a slabby variety
until the effect produced might, profanely speaking, be described as
dinky.</p>

<p>His friends, too, who haunted the house, bore curious conformity to
the furnishing, being individually in various degrees either
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<!-- png 125 -->
squatty, slabby or dinky; and twice a week they gathered for
“Conferences” upon what he and they described as “L’Arr Noovo.”</p>

<p>L’Arr Noovo, a pleasing variation of the slab style in Art, had
profoundly impressed the poet. Glass window-panes, designed with tulip
patterns, were cunningly inserted into all sorts of furniture where
window-glass didn’t belong, and the effect appeared to be profitable;
for up-stairs in his “shop,” workmen were very busy creating
extraordinary designs and setting tulip-patterned glass into everything
with, as the poet explained, “a loving care” and considerable glue.</p>

<p>His four unmarried daughters came to see him, wandering unconcernedly
between the four handsome residences of their four brothers-in-law and
the “den” of the author of their being&mdash;Chlorippe, aged thirteen;
Philodice, fourteen; Dione, fifteen, and Aphrodite,
sixteen&mdash;lovely, fresh-skinned, free-limbed young girls with the
delicate bloom of sun and wind still creaming their
cheeks&mdash;lingering effects of a life lived ever in the open, until
the poet’s sons-in-law were able to support him in town in the style to
which he had been unaccustomed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<!-- png 126 -->
<p>To the Conferences of the poet came the mentally, morally, and
physically dinky&mdash;and a few badgered but normal husbands, hustled
thither by wives whose intellectual development was tending toward the
precious.</p>

<p>People read poems, discussed Yeats, Shaw, Fiona, Mendes, and L’Arr
Noovo; sang, wandered about pinching or thumbing the atmosphere under
stimulus of a cunningly and unexpectedly set window-pane in the back of
a “mission” rocking-chair. And when the proper moment arrived the poet
would rise, exhaling sweetness from every pore of his bulky entity, to
interpret what he called a “Thought.” Sometimes it was a demonstration
of the priceless value of “nothings”; sometimes it was a naive
suggestion that no house could afford to be without an “Art”-rocker with
Arr Noovo insertions. Such indispensable luxuries were on sale
up-stairs. Again, he performed a “necklace of precious sounds”&mdash;in
other words, some verses upon various topics, nature, woodchucks, and
the dinkified in Art.</p>

<p>And it was upon one of these occasions that Aphrodite ran away.</p>

<p>Aphrodite, the sweet, the reasonable, the
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<!-- png 127 -->
self-possessed&mdash;Aphrodite ran away, having without any apparent
reason been stricken with an overpowering aversion for civilization and
Arr Noovo.</p>

the poet’s third Franco-American Conference that afternoon the room was
still vibrating with the echoes of Aphrodite’s harp accompaniment to her
own singing, and gushing approbation had scarcely ceased, when the poet
softly rose and stood with eyes half-closed as though concentrating all
the sweetness within him upon the surface of his pursed lips.</p>

<p>A wan young man whose face figured only as a by-product of his hair
whispered “Hush!” and several people, who seemed to be more or less out
of drawing, assumed
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<!-- png 129 -->
attitudes which emphasized the faulty draftsmanship.</p>

<p>“La Poésie!” breathed the poet; “Kesker say la poésie?”</p>

<p>“La poésie&mdash;say la vee!” murmured a young woman with profuse
teeth.</p>

<p>“Wee, wee, say la vee!” cried several people triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Nong!” sighed the poet, spraying the hushed air with sweetness,
“nong! Say pas le vee; say l’Immortalitay!”</p>

<p>After which the poet resumed his seat, and the by-product read, in
French verse, “An Appreciation” of the works of Wilhelmina Ganderbury
McNutt.</p>

<p>And that was the limit of the Franco portion of the Conference; the
remainder being plain American.</p>

<p>Aphrodite, resting on her tall gilded harp, looked sullenly straight
before her. Somebody lighted a Chinese joss-stick, perhaps to kill the
aroma of defunct cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Verse,” said the poet, opening his heavy lids and gazing around him
with the lambent-eyed wonder of a newly-wakened ram, “verse is a
necklace of tinted sounds strung idly, yet lovingly, upon stray tinseled
threads of
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<!-- png 130 -->
thought.... Thank you for understanding; thank you.”</p>

<p>The by-product in the corner of the studio gathered arms and legs
into a series of acute angles, and writhed; a lady ornamented with
cheek-bones well sketched in, covered her eyes with one hand as though
locked in jiu-jitsu with Richard Strauss.</p>

<p>Aphrodite’s slender fingers, barely resting on the harp-strings,
suddenly contracted in a nervous tremor; a low twang echoed the
involuntary reflex with a discord.</p>

Aphrodite’s slender fingers, barely resting on the harp-strings,<br>
suddenly contracted in a nervous tremor.</p>
<!-- png 132 -->

<p>A young man, whose neck was swathed in a stock à la d’Orsay, bent
close to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I feel that our souls, blindfolded, are groping toward one another,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t talk like that!” she breathed almost fiercely;
“I&nbsp;am tired&mdash;suffocated with sound, drugged with joss-sticks
and sandal. I&nbsp;can’t stand much more, I&nbsp;warn you.”</p>

<p>“Are you not well, beloved.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly well&mdash;physically. I don’t know what it is&mdash;it
has come so suddenly&mdash;this overwhelming revulsion&mdash;this
exasperation with scents and sounds.... I&nbsp;could rip out these
harp-strings and&mdash;and kick that chair
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<!-- png 133 -->
over! I&mdash;I think I need something&mdash;sunlight and the wind
blowing my hair loose<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>The young man with the stock nodded. “It is the exquisite pagan
athirst in you, scorched by the fire of spring. Quench that sweet thirst
at the fount beautiful<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“What fount did you say?” she asked dangerously.</p>

<p>“The precious fount of verse, dear maid.”</p>

<p>“No!” she whispered violently. “I’m half drowned already. Words,
smells, sounds, attitudes, rocking-chairs&mdash;and candles profaning
the sunshine&mdash;I am suffocated, I&nbsp;need more air, more sense and
less incense&mdash;less sound, less art<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Less&mdash;<i>what</i>?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Less art!&mdash;what you call ‘l’arr’!&mdash;yes, I’ve said it; I’m
sick! sick of art! I&nbsp;know what I require now.” And as he remained
agape in shocked silence: “I&nbsp;don’t mean to be rude, Mr. Frawley,
but I also require less of you.... So much less that father will
scarcely expect me to play any more accompaniments to your ‘necklaces of
precious tones’&mdash;so much less that the minimum of my interest in
you vanishes to absolute negation.... So I shall not marry you.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<!-- png 134 -->
<p>“Aphrodite&mdash;are&mdash;are you mad?”</p>

<p>Her sulky red mouth was mute.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the poet’s rich, resonant voice filled the studio with an
agreeable and rambling monotone:</p>

<p>“Verse is a vehicle for expression; expression is a vehicle for
verse; sound, in itself, is so subtly saturated with meaning that it
requires nothing of added logic for its vindication. Sound, therefore,
is sense, modified by the mysterious portent of tone. Thank you for
understanding, thank you for a thought&mdash;very, very precious, a
thought beautiful.”</p>

<p>He smeared the air with inverted thumb and smiled at Mr. Frawley, who
rose, somewhat agitated, and, crooking one lank arm behind his back,
made a mechanical pinch at an atmospheric atom.</p>

<p>“If&mdash;if you do that again&mdash;if you dare to recite those
verses about me, I&nbsp;shall go! I&nbsp;tell you I can’t stand any
more,” breathed Aphrodite between her clenched teeth.</p>

<p>The young man cast his large and rather sickly eyes upon her. For a
moment he was in doubt, but belief in the witchery of sound prevailed,
for he had yet to meet a being insensible to the “music of the soul,”
and so
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<!-- png 135 -->
with a fond and fatuous murmur he pinched the martyred atmosphere once
more, and began, mousily:</p>

<p class = "smallcaps lefthalf">All</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "in3">A tear a year</p>

<p class = "in2">And that is all I ask&mdash;</p>
<p class = "in3">And that is all.</p>
</div>

<p>People were breathing thickly; the poet unaffectedly distilled the
suggested tear; it was a fat tear; it ran smoothly down his nose,
twinkled, trembled, and fell.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<!-- png 136 -->
<p>Aphrodite’s features had become tense; she half rose, hesitated.
Then, as the young man in the stock turned his invalid’s eyes in her
direction and began:</p>

<p>Oh, sixteen tears</p>
<p>In sixteen years<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>she transfixed her hat with one nervous gesture sprang to her feet,
turned, and vanished through the door.</p>

<p>“She is too young to endure it,” sobbed the by-product to her of the
sketchy face. And that was no idle epigram, either.</p>

had no definite idea; all she craved for was the open&mdash;or its
metropolitan substitute&mdash;sunshine, air, the glimpse of sanely
preoccupied faces, the dull, quickening tumult of traffic. The tumult
grew, increasing in her ears as she crossed Washington Square under the
sycamores and looked up through tender feathery foliage at the white
arch of marble through which the noble avenue flows away between its
splendid arid chasms of marble, bronze, and masonry to that blessed
leafy oasis in the north&mdash;the Park.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<!-- png 138 -->
<p>She took an omnibus, impatient for the green rambles of the only
breathing-place she knew of, and settled back in her seat, rebellious of
eye, sullen of mouth, scarcely noticing the amused expression of the
young man opposite.</p>

<p>Two passengers left at Twenty-third Street, three at Thirty-fourth
Street, and seven at Forty-second Street.</p>

<p>Preoccupied, she glanced up at the only passenger remaining, caught
the fleeting shadow of interest on his face, regarded him with natural
indifference, and looked out of the window, forgetting him. A&nbsp;few
moments later, accidentally aware of him again, she carelessly noted his
superficially attractive qualities, and, approving, resumed her idle
inspection of the passing throng. But the next time her pretty head
swung round she found him looking rather fixedly at her, and
involuntarily she returned the gaze with a childlike directness&mdash;a
gaze which he sustained to the limit of good breeding, then evaded so
amiably that it left an impression rather agreeable than otherwise.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” thought Aphrodite, “why I never meet that sort of man.

I&nbsp;have told my brothers-in-law that I am old enough to go out
without coming out.... And I&nbsp;am.”</p>

<p>The lovely mouth grew sullen again: “I don’t wish to wait two years
and be what dreadful newspapers call a ‘bud’! I&nbsp;wish to go to
dinners and dances <i>now</i>!... Where I’ll meet that sort of man....
The sort one feels almost at liberty to talk to without anybody
presenting anybody.... I’ve a mind to look amiable the next time he<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He raised his eyes at that instant; but she did not smile.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I suppose that is the effect of civilization on me,” she
reflected&mdash;“metropolitan civilization. I&nbsp;felt like saying,
‘For goodness’ sake, let’s say something’&mdash;even in spite of all my
sisters have told me. I&nbsp;can’t see why it would be dangerous for me
to <i>look</i> amiable. If he glances at me again&mdash;so
agreeably<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He did; but she didn’t smile.</p>

<p>“You see!” she said, accusing herself discontentedly; “you don’t dare
look human. Why? Because you’ve had it so drummed
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<!-- png 140 -->
into you that you can never, never again do anything natural. Why? Oh,
because they all begin to talk about mysterious dangers when you say you
wish to be natural.... I’ve made up my mind to look interested the next
time he turns.... Why shouldn’t he see that I’m quite willing to talk to
him?... And I’m so tired of looking out of the window.... Before I came
to this curious city I was never afraid to speak to anybody who
attracted me.... And I’m not now.... So if he does look at me<span class
= "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He did.</p>

<p>The faintest glimmer of a smile troubled her lips. She thought:
“I&nbsp;<i>do</i> wish he’d speak!”</p>

<p>There was a very becoming color in his face, partly because he was
experienced enough not to mistake her; partly from a sudden and complete
realization of her beauty.</p>

<p>“It’s so odd,” thought Aphrodite, “that attractive people consider it
dangerous to speak to one another. I&nbsp;don’t see any danger....
I&nbsp;wonder what he has in that square box beside him? It can’t be a
camera.... It <i>can’t</i> be a folding easel! It simply <i>can’t</i> be
that <i>he</i> is an artist! a man like that<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<!-- png 141 -->
<p>“<i>Are</i> you?” she asked quite involuntarily.</p>

<p>“What?” he replied, astonished, wheeling around.</p>

<p>“An&mdash;an artist. I can’t believe it, and I don’t wish to! You
don’t look it, you know!”</p>

<p>For a moment he could scarcely realize that she had spoken; his keen
gaze dissected the face before him, the unembarrassed eyes, the oval
contour, the smooth, flawless loveliness of a child.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am an artist,” he said, considering her curiously.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said, “no, not sorry&mdash;only unpleasantly
surprised. You see I am so tired of art&mdash;and I thought you looked
so&mdash;so wholesome<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He began to laugh&mdash;a modulated laugh&mdash;rather infectious,
too, for Aphrodite bit her lip, then smiled, not exactly understanding
it all.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh?” she asked, still smiling. “Have I said something
I should not have said?”</p>

<p>But he replied with a question: “Have you found art unwholesome?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” she answered with a little sigh; “I&nbsp;am
so tired of it all. Don’t let us talk about it&mdash;will you?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<!-- png 142 -->
<p>“It isn’t often I talk about it,” he said, laughing again.</p>

<p>“Oh! That is unusual. Why don’t you talk about art?”</p>

<p>“I’m much too busy.”</p>

<p>“D&mdash;doing what? If that is not <i>very</i> impertinent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, making pictures of things,” he said, intensely amused.</p>

<p>“Pictures? You don’t talk about art, and you paint pictures!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“W&mdash;what kind? Do you mind my asking? You are so&mdash;so very
unusual.”</p>

<p>“Well, to earn my living, I make full-page pictures for magazines; to
satisfy an absurd desire, I&nbsp;paint
people&mdash;things&mdash;anything that might satisfy my color senses.”
He shrugged his shoulders gaily. “You see, I’m the sort you are so tired
of<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“But you <i>paint</i>! The artists I know don’t paint&mdash;except
<i>that</i> way&mdash;” She raised her pretty gloved thumb and made a
gesture in the air; and, before she had achieved it, they were both
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>“You never do that, do you?” she asked at length.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<!-- png 143 -->
<p>“No, I&nbsp;never do. I&nbsp;can’t afford to decorate the atmosphere
for nothing!”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;then you are not interested in art nouveau?”</p>

<p>“No; and I never could see that beautiful music resembled frozen
architecture.”</p>

<p>They were laughing again, looking with confidence and delight upon
one another as though they had started life’s journey together in that
ancient omnibus.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> is a ‘necklace of precious tones’?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Precious stones?”</p>

<p>“No, <i>tones</i>!”</p>

<p>“Let me cite, as an example, those beautiful verses of Henry Haynes,”
he replied gravely.</p>

<p class = "lefthalf">TO BE OR NOT TO BE</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>I’d rather be a Could Be,</p>

<p>And they fell a-laughing so shamelessly that the ’bus driver turned
and squinted through his shutter at them, and the scandalized horses
stopped of their own accord.</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave?” he asked as she rose.</p>

<p>“Yes; this is the Park,” she said. “Thank you, and good-by.”</p>

<p>He held the door for her; she nodded her thanks and descended,
turning frankly to smile again in acknowledgment of his quickly lifted
hat.</p>

<p>“He <i>was</i> nice,” she reflected a trifle guiltily, “and I had a
good time, and I really don’t see any danger in&nbsp;it.”</p>

drew a deep, sweet breath as she entered the leafy shade and looked up
into the bluest of cloudless skies. Odors of syringa and lilac freshened
her, cleansing her of the last lingering taint of joss-sticks. The
cardinal birds were very busy in the scarlet masses of Japanese quince;
orioles fluttered among golden Forsythia; here and there an exotic
starling preened and peered at the burnished purple grackle, stalking
solemnly through the tender grass.</p>

<p>For an hour she walked vigorously, enchanted with the sun and sky and
living green, through arbors heavy with wistaria, iris hued
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<!-- png 146 -->
and scented, through rambles under tall elms tufted with new leaves,
past fountains splashing over, past lakes where water-fowl floated or
stretched brilliant wings in the late afternoon sunlight. At times the
summer wind blew her hair, and she lifted her lips to it, caressing it
with every fiber of her; at times she walked pensively, wondering why
she had been forbidden the Park unless accompanied.</p>

<p>“More danger, I suppose,” she thought impatiently.... “Well, what is
this danger that seems to travel like one’s shadow, dogging a girl
through the world? It seems to me that if all the pleasant things of
life are so full of danger I’d better find out what it is....
I&nbsp;might as well look for it so that I’ll recognize it when I
encounter it.... And learn to keep away.”</p>

<p>She scanned the flowery thickets attentively, looked behind her, then
walked&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>“If it’s robbers they mean,” she reflected, “I’m a good wrestler, and
I can make any one of my four brothers-in-law look foolish.... Besides,
the Park is full of fat policemen.... And if they mean I’m likely to get
lost, or run over, or arrested, or poisoned with soda-water and
bonbons&mdash;” She
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<!-- png 147 -->
laughed to herself, swinging on in her free-limbed, wholesome beauty,
scarcely noticing a man ahead, occupying a bench half hidden under the
maple’s foliage.</p>

<p>“So I’ll just look about for this danger they are all afraid of, and
when I see it, I’ll know what to do,” she concluded, paying not the
slightest heed to the man on the bench until he rose, as she passed him,
and took off his hat.</p>

<p>“You!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>She had stopped short, confronting him with the fearless and charming
directness natural to her. “What an amusing accident,” she said
frankly.</p>

<p>“The truth is,” he began, “it is not exactly an accident.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no.... Are you offended?”</p>

<p>“Offended? No. Should I be? Why?... Besides, I&nbsp;suppose when we
have finished this conversation you are going the <i>other</i> way.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;no, I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then you are going to sit here?”</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;yes&mdash;I suppose so.... But I don’t want&nbsp;to.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<!-- png 148 -->
<p>“Well, if I’m not going the <i>other</i> way, and if I’m not going to
remain here&mdash;” He looked at her, half laughing. She laughed, too,
not exactly knowing why.</p>

<p>“Don’t you really mind my walking a little way with you?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, I&nbsp;don’t. Why should I? Is there any reason? Am I not old
enough to know why we should not walk together? Is it because the sun is
going down? Is there what people call ‘danger’?”</p>

<p>He was so plainly taken aback that her fair young face became
seriously curious.</p>

<p>“<i>Is</i> there any reason why you should not walk with me?” she
persisted.</p>

<p>The clear, direct gaze challenged him. He hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” he said.</p>

<p>“A&mdash;a reason why you should not walk with&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>And, as he did not find words to answer, she studied him for a
moment, glanced up and down the woodland walk, then impulsively seated
herself and motioned him to a place beside her on the bench.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<!-- png 149 -->
<p>“Now,” she said, “I’m in a position to find out just what this danger
is that they all warn me about. <i>You</i> know, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Know what?” he answered.</p>

<p>“About the danger that I seem to run every time I manage to enjoy
myself.... And you <i>do</i> know; I&nbsp;see it by the way you look at
me&mdash;and your expression is just like their expression when they
tell me not to do things I find most natural.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I&mdash;you<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“You <i>must</i> tell me! I shall be thoroughly vexed with you if you
don’t.”</p>

<p>Then he began to laugh, and she let him, leaning back to watch him
with uncertain and speculative blue eyes. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>“You are absolutely unlike any girl I ever heard of. I&nbsp;am trying
to get used to it&mdash;to adjust things. Will you help&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“How?” she asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Well, by telling me”&mdash;he looked at her a moment&mdash;“your
age. You look about nineteen.”</p>

<p>“I am sixteen and a half. I and all my sisters have developed our
bodies so perfectly because, until we came to New York last autumn,
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<!-- png 150 -->
we had lived all our lives out-of-doors.” She looked at him with a
friendly smile. “Would you really like to know about&nbsp;us?”</p>

<p>“Intensely.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are eight of us: Chlorippe, thirteen; Philodice,
fourteen; Dione, fifteen; Aphrodite, sixteen&mdash;I am Aphrodite;
Cybele, seventeen, married; Lissa, eighteen, married; Iole, nineteen,
married, and Vanessa, twenty, married.” She raised one small, gloved
finger to emphasize the narrative. “All our lives we were brought up to
be perfectly natural, to live, act, eat, sleep, play like primitive
people. Our father dressed us like youths&mdash;boys, you know. Why,”
she said earnestly, “until we came to New York we had no idea that girls
wore such lovely, fluffy underwear&mdash;but I believe I am not to
mention such things; at least they have told me not to&mdash;but my
straight front is still a novelty to me, and so are my stockings, so you
won’t mind if I’ve said something I shouldn’t, will you?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said; his face was expressionless.</p>

<p>“Then <i>that’s</i> all right. So you see how it is; we don’t quite
know what we may do in this city. At first we were delighted to see so
many attractive men, and we wanted to speak
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<!-- png 151 -->
to some of them who seemed to want to speak to us, but my father put a
stop to that&mdash;but it’s absurd to think all those men might be
robbers, isn’t&nbsp;it?”</p>

<p>“Very.” There was not an atom of intelligence left in his face.</p>

<p>“So <i>that’s</i> all right, then. Let me see, what was I saying? Oh,
yes, I&nbsp;know! So four of my sisters were married, and we four
remaining are being civilized.... But, oh&mdash;I wish I could be in the
country for a little while! I’m so homesick for the meadows and brooks
and my pajamas and my bare feet in sandals again.... And people seem to
know so little in New York, and nobody understands us when we make
little jests in Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, and nobody seems to have
been very well educated and accomplished, so we feel strange at
times.”</p>

<p>“D&mdash;d&mdash;do you <i>do</i> all those things?”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“M&mdash;make jests in Arabic?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No. What else do you do?”</p>

<p>“Why, not many things.”</p>

<p>“Music?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<!-- png 152 -->
<p>“Piano?”</p>

<p>“Yes, piano, violin, harp, guitar, zither&mdash;all that sort of
thing.... Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No. What else?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;just various things, ride, swim, fence, box&mdash;I box
pretty well&mdash;all those things<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Science, too?”</p>

<p>“Rudiments. Of course I couldn’t, for example, discourse with
authority upon the heteropterous mictidæ or tell you in what genus or
genera the prothorax and femora are digitate; or whether climatic and
polymorphic forms of certain diurnal lepidoptera occur within certain
boreal limits. I&nbsp;have only a vague and superficial knowledge of any
science, you see.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>She leaned <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘foward’">forward</ins> thoughtfully, her pretty hands loosely
interlaced upon her knee.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “tell me about this danger that such a girl as I
must guard against.”</p>

<p>“There is no danger,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“But they told me<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Let them tell you what it is, then.”</p>

<p>“No; you tell me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<!-- png 153 -->
<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;I simply can’t.”</p>

<p>“Are you ashamed to?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;” He lifted his boxed sketching-kit by the strap,
swung it, then set it carefully upon the ground: “Perhaps it is because
I am ashamed to admit that there could be any danger to any woman in
this world of men.”</p>

<p>She looked at him so seriously that he straightened up and began to
laugh. But she did not forget anything he had said, and she began her
questions at once:</p>

<p>“Why should you not walk with me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take that back,” he said, still laughing; “there is every
reason why I should walk with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!... But you said<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“All I meant was not for you, but for the ordinary sort of girl. Now,
the ordinary, every-day, garden girl does not concern you<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, she does! Why am I not like her?”</p>

<p>“Don’t attempt to be<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“<i>Am</i> I different&mdash;very different?”</p>

<p>“Superbly different!” The flush came to his face with the impulsive
words.</p>

<p>She considered him in silence, then:
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<!-- png 154 -->
“Should I have been offended because you came into the Park to find me?
And why did you? Do you find me interesting?”</p>

<p>“So interesting,” he said, “that I don’t know what I shall do when
you go away.”</p>

<p>Another pause; she was deeply absorbed with her own thoughts. He
watched her, the color still in his face, and in his eyes a growing
fascination.</p>

<p>“I’m not out,” she said, resting her chin on one gloved hand, “so
we’re not likely to meet at any of those jolly things you go to. What do
you think we’d better do?&mdash;because they’ve all warned me against
doing just what you and I have done.”</p>

<p>“Speaking without knowing each other?” he asked guiltily.</p>

<p>“Yes.... But I did it first to you. Still, when I tell them about it,
they won’t let you come to visit me. I&nbsp;tried it once. I&nbsp;was in
a car, and such an attractive man looked at me as though he wanted to
speak, and so when I got out of the car he got out, and I thought he
seemed rather timid, so I asked him where Tiffany’s was. I&nbsp;really
didn’t know, either. So we had such a jolly walk together up Fifth
Avenue, and when I
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<!-- png 155 -->
said good-by he was so anxious to see me again, and I told him where I
lived. But&mdash;do you know?&mdash;when I explained about it at home
they acted so strangely, and they never would tell me whether or not he
ever came.”</p>

<p>“Then you intend to tell them all about&mdash;<i>us</i>?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’ve disobeyed them.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and I am never to see you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m very disobedient,” she said innocently. “If I wanted to see
you I’d do&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“But <i>do</i> you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am not sure. Do you want to see me?”</p>

<p>His answer was stammered and almost incoherent. That, and the color
in his face and the <i>something</i> in his eyes, interested her.</p>

<p>“Do you really find me so attractive?” she asked, looking him
directly in the eyes. “You must answer me quickly; see how dark it is
growing! I&nbsp;must go. Tell me, do you like&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“I never cared so much for&mdash;for any woman<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>.”</p>

<p>She dimpled with delight and lay back regarding him under level,
unembarrassed brows.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<!-- png 156 -->
<p>“That is very pleasant,” she said. “I’ve often wished that a
man&mdash;of your kind&mdash;would say that to me. I&nbsp;do wish we
could be together a great deal, because you like me so much already and
I truly do find you agreeable.... Say it to me again&mdash;about how
much you like&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;there is no woman&mdash;none I ever saw so&mdash;so
interesting.... I&nbsp;mean more than that.”</p>

<p>“Say it then.”</p>

<p>“Say what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Of what?”</p>

<p>“Of offending you<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Is it an offense to me to tell me how much you like me? <i>How</i>
can it offend&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;it is incredible! You won’t believe<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Believe what?”</p>

<p>“That in so short a time I&mdash;I could care for you so much<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“But I shall believe you. I know how I feel toward you. And every
time you speak to me I feel more&nbsp;so.”</p>

<p>“Feel more so?” he stammered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<!-- png 157 -->
<p>“Yes, I&nbsp;experience more delight in what you say. Do you think I
am insensible to the way you look at&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you mean&mdash;” He simply could not find words.</p>

<p>She leaned back, watching him with sweet composure; then laughed a
little and said: “Do you suppose that you and I are going to fall in
love with one another?”</p>

<p>In the purpling dusk the perfume of wistaria grew sweeter and
sweeter.</p>

<p>“I’ve done it already&mdash;” His voice shook and failed; a thrush,
invisible in shadowy depths, made soft, low sounds.</p>

<p>“You <i>love</i> me&mdash;already?” she exclaimed under her
breath.</p>

<p>“Love you! I&mdash;I&mdash;there are no words&mdash;” The thrush
stirred the sprayed foliage and called once, then again, restless for
the moon.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered over him thoughtfully: “So <i>that</i> is love....
I&nbsp;didn’t know.... I&nbsp;supposed it could be nothing pleasanter
than friendship, although they say it is.... But how could it be? There
is nothing pleasanter than friendship.... I&nbsp;am perfectly delighted
that you love me. Shall we marry some day, do you think?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<!-- png 158 -->
<p>He strove to speak, but her frankness stunned him.</p>

<p>“I meant to tell you that I am engaged,” she observed. “Does that
matter?”</p>

<p>“Engaged!” He found his tongue quickly enough then; and she,
surprised, interested, and in nowise dissenting, listened to his
eloquent views upon the matter of Mr. Frawley, whom she, during the
lucid intervals of his silence, curtly described.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said with great relief, “that I always felt that
way about love, because I never knew anything about it except from the
symptoms of Mr. Frawley? So when they told me that love and friendship
were different, I&nbsp;supposed it must be so, and I had no high opinion

anything else.... I&nbsp;could sit here with you all day, listening to
you. Tell me some more.”</p>

did. She listened, sometimes intently interested, absorbed, sometimes
leaning back dreamily, her eyes partly veiled under silken lashes, her
mouth curved with the vaguest of smiles.</p>

<p>He spoke as a man who awakes with a start&mdash;not very clearly at
first, then with feverish coherence, at times with recklessness almost
eloquent. Still only half awakened himself, still scarcely convinced,
scarcely credulous that this miracle of an hour had been wrought in him,
here under the sky and setting sun and new-born leaves, he spoke not
only to her
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<!-- png 160 -->
but of her to himself, formulating in words the rhythm his pulses were
beating, interpreting this surging tide which thundered in his heart,
clamoring out the fact&mdash;the fact&mdash;the fact that he
loved!&mdash;that love was on him like the grip of Fate&mdash;on him so
suddenly, so surely, so inexorably, that, stricken as he was, the clutch
only amazed and numbed him.</p>

<p>He spoke, striving to teach himself that the incredible was credible,
the impossible possible&mdash;that it was done! done! done! and that he
loved a woman in an hour because, in an hour, he had read her innocence
as one reads through crystal, and his eyes were opened for the first
time upon loveliness unspoiled, sweetness untainted, truth
uncompromised.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said, “that, as you speak, you make me care for
you so much more than I supposed a girl could care for a man?”</p>

<p>“Can you love me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I&nbsp;do already! I don’t mean mere love. It is
something&mdash;<i>something</i> that I never knew about before.
<i>Every</i>thing about you is so&mdash;so exactly what I care
for&mdash;your voice, your head, the way you think, the way you look at
me. I&nbsp;never thought of men as I am
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<!-- png 161 -->
thinking about you.... I&nbsp;want you to belong to me&mdash;all
alone.... I&nbsp;want to see how you look when you are angry, or
worried, or tired. I&nbsp;want you to think of me when you are perplexed
and unhappy and ill. Will you? You <i>must</i>! There is nobody else, is
there? If you do truly love&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Nobody but you.”</p>

<p>“That is what I desire.... I want to live with you&mdash;I promise I
won’t talk about art&mdash;even <i>your</i> art, which I might learn to
care for. All I want is to really live and have your troubles to meet
and overcome them because I will not permit anything to harm you....
I&nbsp;will love you enough for that.... I&mdash;do you love other
women?”</p>

<p>“Good God, no!”</p>

<p>“And you shall not!” She leaned closer, looking him through and
through. “I&nbsp;<i>will</i> be what you love! I&nbsp;will be what you
desire most in all the world. I&nbsp;<i>will</i> be to you everything
you wish, in every way, always, ever, and forever and ever.... Will you
marry&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Will <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She suddenly stripped off her glove,
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<!-- png 162 -->
wrenched a ring set with brilliants from the third finger of her left
hand, and, rising, threw it, straight as a young boy throws, far out
into deepening twilight. It was the end of Mr. Frawley; he, too, had not
only become a by-product but a good-by product. Yet his modest demands
had merely required a tear a year! Perhaps he had not asked enough. Love
pardons the selfish.</p>

<p>She was laughing, a trifle excited, as she turned to face him where
he had risen. But, at the touch of his hand on hers, the laughter died
at a breath, and she stood, her limp hand clasped in his, silent,
expressionless, save for the tremor of her mouth.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I must go,” she said, shrinking from him.</p>

<p>He did not understand, thrilled as he was by the contact, but he let
her soft hand fall away from his.</p>

<p>Then with a half sob she caught her own fingers to her lips and
kissed them where the pressure of his hand burned her white
flesh&mdash;kissed them, looking at him.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you find a child&mdash;you leave a woman,” she said
unsteadily. “Do you understand how I love you&mdash;for that?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<!-- png 163 -->
<p>He caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not yet&mdash;not my mouth!” she pleaded, holding him back;
“I&nbsp;love you too much&mdash;already <i>too</i> much. Wait! Oh,
<i>will</i> you wait?... And let me wait&mdash;<i>make</i> me wait?...
I&mdash;I begin to understand some things I did not know an hour
ago.”</p>

<p>In the dusk he could scarcely see her as she swayed, yielding, her
arms tightening about his neck in the first kiss she had ever given or
forgiven in all her life.</p>

<p>And through the swimming tumult of their senses the thrush’s song
rang like a cry. The moon had risen.</p>

the deadened stairway noiselessly to her sister’s room, groping for the
door in the dark of the landing, she called: “Iole!” And again: “Iole!
Come to me! It is&nbsp;I!”</p>

<p>The door swung noiselessly; a dim form stole forward, wide-eyed and
white in the electric light.</p>

<p>Then down at her sister’s feet dropped Aphrodite, and laid a burning
face against her silken knees. And, “Oh, Iole, Iole,” she whispered,
“Iole, Iole, Iole! There is danger, as you say&mdash;there is, and I
understand it ... now.... But I love him so&mdash;I&mdash;I have been so
happy&mdash;so happy! Tell me what I
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<!-- png 165 -->
have done ... and how wrong it is! Oh, Iole, Iole! What have I
done!”</p>

<p>“Done, child! What in the name of all the gods have you done?”</p>

<p>“Loved him&mdash;in the names of all the gods! Oh, Iole! Iole!
Iole!”</p>

<p class = "dots">&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The thrush singing in
darkness; the voice of spring calling, calling me to his arms! Oh, Iole,
Iole!&mdash;these, and my soul and his, alone under the pagan moon!
alone, save for the old gods whispering in the dusk<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p class = "dots">&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And listening, I heard the
feathery tattoo of wings close by&mdash;the wings of Eros all aquiver
like a soft moth trembling ere it flies! Peril divine! I&nbsp;understood
it then. And, stirring in darkness, sweet as the melody of unseen
streams, I&nbsp;heard the old gods laughing.... <i>Then</i> I knew.”</p>

<p class = "dots">&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Is that all, little sister?”</p>

<p>“Almost all.”</p>

<p>“What more?”</p>

<p class = "dots">&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when, at length, the trembling tale was told, Iole caught her in
her white arms, looked
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<!-- png 166 -->
at her steadily, then kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>“If he is all you say&mdash;this miracle&mdash;I&mdash;I think I can
make them understand,” she whispered. “Where is&nbsp;he?”</p>

<p>“D-down-stairs&mdash;at b-bay! Hark! You can hear George swearing!
Oh, Iole, don’t let him!”</p>

<p>In the silence from the drawing-room below came the solid sobs of the
poet:</p>

<p>“P-pup! P-p-penniless pup!”</p>

<p>“He <i>must</i> not say that!” cried Aphrodite fiercely. “Can’t you
make father and George understand that he has nearly six hundred dollars
in the bank?”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Iole tenderly. “Come!”</p>

<p>And with one arm around Aphrodite she descended the great stairway,
where, on the lower landing, immensely interested, sat Chlorippe,
Philodice and Dione, observant, fairly aquiver with intelligence.</p>

<p>“Oh, that young man is catching it!” remarked Dione, looking up as
Iole passed, her arm close around her sister’s waist. “George has said
‘dammit’ seven times and father is rocking&mdash;not in a
rocking-chair&mdash;just rocking and expressing his inmost thoughts.
And&nbsp;Mr.
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<!-- png 167 -->
Briggs pretends to scowl and mutters: ‘Hook him over the ropes, George.
’E ain’t got no friends!’ Take a peep, Iole. You can just see them if
you lean over and hang on to the banisters<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>But Iole brushed by her younger sisters, Aphrodite close beside her,
and, entering the great receiving-hall, stood still, her clear eyes
focused upon her husband’s back.</p>

<p>“George!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wayne stiffened and wheeled; Mr. Briggs sidled hastily toward the
doorway, crabwise; the poet choked back the word, “Phup!” and gazed at
his tall daughter with apprehension and protruding lips.</p>

<p>“Iole,” began Wayne, “this is no place for you! Aphrodite! let that
fellow alone, I&nbsp;say!”</p>

<p>Iole turned, following with calm eyes the progress of her sister
toward a tall young man who stood by the window, a red flush staining
his strained face.</p>

<p>The tense muscles in jaw and cheek relaxed as Aphrodite laid one hand
on his arm; the poet, whose pursed lips were overloaded, expelled a
passionate “Phupp!” and the young man’s eyes narrowed again at the
shot.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<!-- png 168 -->
<p>Then silence lengthened to a waiting menace, and even the three
sisters on the stairs succumbed to the oppressive stillness. And all the
while Iole stood like a white Greek goddess under the glory of her hair,
looking full into the eyes of the tall stranger.</p>

<p>A minute passed; a glimmer dawned to a smile and trembled in the
azure of Iole’s eyes; she slowly lifted her arms, white hands
outstretched, looking steadily at the stranger.</p>

<p>He came, tense, erect; Iole’s cool hands dropped in his. And, turning
to the others with a light on her face that almost blinded him, she
said, laughing: “Do you not understand? Aphrodite brings us the rarest
gift in the world in this tall young brother! Look! Touch him! We have
never seen his like before for all the wisdom of wise years. For he is
one of few&mdash;and men are many, and artists legion&mdash;this
honorable miracle, this sane and wholesome wonder! this trinity, Lover,
Artist, and Man!”</p>

<p>And, turning again, she looked him wistfully, wonderingly, in the
eyes.</p>
